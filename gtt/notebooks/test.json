{"doc_id": "TST3-WIKI-0000", "doctext": "The Taliban killed more than 100 members of the Afghan security forces inside a military compound in central Maidan Wardak province on Monday, a senior defense official said.\"We have information that 126 people have been killed in the explosion inside the military training center, eight special commandoes are among the dead,\" said a senior official in the defense ministry in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity.The official said the assault began on Monday morning when the attackers rammed a car full explosives through a military checkpoint and detonated the vehicle inside the campus of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) forces training center in Maidan Shahr, the capital of Maidan Wardak province.Two gunmen entered the campus right after the explosion and shot at many Afghan soldiers before being gunned down during the clashes.Defense ministry officials said the Taliban had used U.S.-made armored Humvee vehicles captured from Afghan forces as a car bomb in order to breach the military fortifications.A second source residing in Maidan Wardak province said more than 100 members of National Directorate of Security (NDS) were killed in the complex attack.\"I have been in touch with the NDS official in the province and they told me that over 100 members of the NDS were killed in the big explosion,\" the former provincial official said.Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak said he saw bodies of 35 Afghan forces in the hospital.\"Many more were killed. Several bodies were transported to Kabul city and many injured were transferred to hospitals in Kabul,\" said Hotak, adding that \"the government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in the morale of the Afghan forces.\"\"The explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed,\" he said.Government officials in Maidan Wardak and Kabul declined to comment when asked if they were obscuring the death toll.Two senior officials in the interior ministry said the exact casualty figures were not being disclosed to prevent unrest within the armed forces.\"I have been told not to make the death toll figures public. It is frustrating to hide the facts,\" said a senior interior ministry official in Kabul.A senior NDS official in Kabul said at least 50 people were killed or wounded in the complex attack.Abdurrahman Mangal, spokesman for the provincial governor in Maidan Wardak said 12 people were killed and 12 were injured when the car bomb exploded near the Afghan special forces unit.President Ashraf Ghani's office in a statement said the \"enemies of the country\" had carried out an attack against NDS personnel in Maidan Shahr. \"They killed and wounded a number of our beloved and honest sons.\"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan condemned the attack on Monday evening and extended his condolences to Ghani.Meanwhile, the Taliban said it met with U.S. officials in Qatar on Monday, in the latest round of talks between the insurgents and Washington aimed at bringing an end to the 17-year war.The U.S. has not officially commented on the reported meeting, which follows the last confirmed talks between the two parties in the UAE in December.\"Following American acceptance of the agenda of ending the occupation of Afghanistan and preventing Afghanistan from being used against other countries in the future, talks with American representatives took place today in Doha, the capital of Qatar,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.Taliban representatives have met several times with U.S. officials in recent months, but last week threatened to suspend the fledgling process, lambasting Washington for changing the agenda of the talks and \"unilaterally\" adding new subjects.The insurgents have long refused to hold direct talks with the Kabul government -- despite U.S. pleas -- which the Taliban dismisses as a puppet of Washington.In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures. Last year Ghani has said 28,000 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015, breaking the longstanding suppression on casualty data.Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline terrorist group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack.Last week, Taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 Afghans and expatriates in the capital, Kabul.On Sunday, a suicide bombing in the southeastern province of Logar left eight policemen dead and another 10 wounded.The Taliban bombing targeted the provincial governor's convoy in Mohammad Agha district. The provincial governor and spy chief traveling in the convoy were unharmed.The Taliban have ramped up their attacks on security forces and government facilities in recent months, while Afghan and U.S. troops have increased operations against the militants' field commanders.Military sources say around 35 members of the country's security forces are killed every day in attacks and clashes.This is while the U.S. is still considering a significant troop drawdown in Afghanistan. Around 14,000 U.S. troops are stationed in the country, coupled with around 7,500 troops from other allied nations, according to RAND, a U.S. government research organization.In a report on Sunday, RAND said that if the U.S. considers \"an early and complete or near-complete departure unrelated to a negotiated peace settlement,\" it could push Afghanistan into a civil war while the Taliban would expand their control throughout the country.If the withdrawal does take place, RAND noted, \"the major advances that Afghans have achieved in democracy, press freedom, human rights, women's emancipation, literacy, longevity, and living standards will be rolled back throughout the country.\"", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["members", 33]], "Place": [], "Killer": [["The Taliban", 0]], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": [["training center", 265]]}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["people", 204]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [["campus", 589]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["explosives", 511]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [["gunmen", 724]], "Target": [["soldiers", 800]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": [["campus", 589]]}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["members", 33]], "Place": [["complex", 1168]], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Cognitive.IdentifyCategorize.Unspecified", "Identifier": [["he", 1]], "IdentifiedObject": [["bodies", 1442]], "IdentifiedRole": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": [["southeastern", 4538]]}, {"incident_type": "Life.Injure.Unspecified", "Victim": [["10", 29]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["policemen", 4580]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [["convoy", 4673]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["members", 33]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Contact.Contact.Correspondence", "Participant": [["I", 1184], ["official", 160]], "Instrument": [], "Topic": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Movement.Transportation.Unspecified", "Transporter": [], "PassengerArtifact": [["bodies", 1442]], "Vehicle": [], "Origin": [], "Destination": [["Kabul city", 1544]]}, {"incident_type": "Movement.Transportation.Unspecified", "Transporter": [], "PassengerArtifact": [["injured", 1564]], "Vehicle": [], "Origin": [], "Destination": [["hospitals", 1592]]}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [["members", 33]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": [["complex", 1168]]}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["members", 33]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Injure.Unspecified", "Victim": [["Afghans", 4456], ["expatriates", 4468]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["people", 204]], "Place": [], "Killer": [["fighters", 4336]], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["car bomb", 973]], "Place": [["highly fortified compound", 4374]]}, {"incident_type": "Contact.Contact.Meet", "Participant": [["officials", 870], ["Taliban", 4]], "Topic": [["bringing an end", 3007]], "Place": [["Qatar", 2914]]}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["beloved and honest sons", 2715]], "Place": [], "Killer": [["They", 2675]], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Injure.Unspecified", "Victim": [["beloved and honest sons", 2715]], "Injurer": [["They", 2675]], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}]}

I would like to begin in the name of Allah, the exalted and glorious, the most gracious, the most merciful, \u201cAllah\u201d among the most beautiful names. Any act that does not begin in the name of God is separate from goodness.This is the blessed month of Ramadan, and it is the month of mercy from Allah to his creation, a month to ask forgiveness of Allah and of his creation, a month to express gratitude to Allah and to his creation. It\u2019s the month of reconciliation, a month of patience, a month during which hearts change. Indeed, a month of many blessings.The Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, said if you have not thanked the people, you have not thanked God. So I would like to first thank my attorneys, those who sit at this table, the table behind me, and many more behind the scenes. They have done much good for me, for my family. They made my life the last two years very easy. I cherish their company. They\u2019re lovely companions. I thank you.AdvertisementI would like to thank those who took time out of their daily lives to come and testify on my behalf despite the pressure. I\u2019d like to thank the jury for their service, and the Court. The Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, said that if you do not -- if you are not merciful to Allah\u2019s creation, Allah will not be merciful to you, so I\u2019d like to now apologize to the victims, to the survivors.AdvertisementImmediately after the bombing, which I am guilty of -- if there\u2019s any lingering doubt about that, let there be no more. I did do it along with my brother -- I learned of some of the victims. I learned their names, their faces, their age. And throughout this trial more of those victims were given names, more of those victims had faces, and they had burdened souls.Now, all those who got up on that witness stand and that podium related to us -- to me -- I was listening -- the suffering that was and the hardship that still is, with strength and with patience and with dignity. Now, Allah says in the Qur\u2019an that no soul is burdened with more than it can bear, and you told us just how unbearable it was, how horrendous it was, this thing I put you through. And I know that you kept that much. I know that there isn\u2019t enough time in the day for you to have related to us everything. I also wish that far more people had a chance to get up there, but I took them from you.Now, I am sorry for the lives that I\u2019ve taken, for the suffering that I\u2019ve caused you, for the damage that I\u2019ve done. Irreparable damage.Now, I am a Muslim. My religion is Islam. The God I worship, besides whom there is no other God, is Allah. And I prayed for Allah to bestow his mercy upon the deceased, those affected in the bombing and their families. Allah says in the Qur\u2019an that with every hardship there is relief. I pray for your relief, for your healing, for your well-being, for your strength.AdvertisementI ask Allah to have mercy upon me and my brother and my family. I ask Allah to bestow his mercy upon those present here today. And Allah knows best those deserving of his mercy. And I ask Allah to have mercy upon the ummah of Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. Amin. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.Thank you.Milton J.

{"doc_id": "TST3-WIKI-0002", "doctext": "Boston Marathon Bomber Apologizes to SurvivorsBOSTON \u2014\u00a0Moments before a federal judge sentenced him to death, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev rose to his feet Wednesday and apologized to the victims and their loved ones for the first time.\"I pray for your relief, for your healing,'' he said.Amid deep silence in the courtroom, the 21-year-old ethnic Chechen said, \"I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I've caused you, for the damage that I've done \u2014 irreparable damage.''It was the first time Tsarnaev, who did not speak in his own defense at trial, had addressed the court.After Tsarnaev finished, U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. began to speak, with his voice breaking several times. He officially imposed the death sentence on Tsarnaev that jurors had recommended unanimously.In May, after a 12-week trial, Tsarnaev was found guilty of killing three people and injuring 264 in the April 15, 2013, bombing at the world-renowned race, where he and his brother, Tamerlan, 26, set off two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line.Tsarnaev was also found guilty in the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer three days later as he and his brother fled. Tamerlan was killed during the getaway.Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 terrorism and other charges against him. Of those, 17 carried the possibility of a death sentence.During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings, prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older, radicalized brother.Victims speak outBefore the sentencing, a somber-looking Tsarnaev, wearing a dark sport jacket with a collared shirt and no tie, sat between his lawyers and listened as 24 people \u2014 some victims, some survivors \u2014 gave impact statements. They lashed out at him for his \u201ccowardly\u201d and \u201cdisgusting\u201d acts, and several called upon him to apologize, trying to convince him that this would be his last chance to ask for forgiveness.Tsarnaev, his chair turned toward the lectern from which the victims spoke, picked at his beard and gazed downward most of the time, only occasionally looking at the speakers.Patricia Campbell, the mother of Krystle Campbell, 29, who was killed in the attack, was the first person to address the court. She looked across the room at Tsarnaev, seated about 20 feet away, and spoke directly to him.\u201cWhat you did to my daughter is disgusting,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't know what to say to you. I think the jury did the right thing.\u201dKrystle Campbell's best friend, Karen Rand McWatters, who lost a leg in the attack, said Tsarnaev \"can't possibly have had a soul to do such a horrible thing.\u201dIn a message he scrawled in the boat he was found hiding in, Tsarnaev said the attack was retaliation against the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. McWatters urged Tsarnaev to show remorse to discourage other jihadis from killing people in similar attacks. \u201cYou can save them from these cowardly acts if you really have an ounce of regret,\u201d she said.Rebekah Gregory, a Texas woman who lost a leg in the bombing, defiantly told Tsarnaev she was not his victim.\u201cWhile your intention was to destroy America, what you have really accomplished is actually quite the opposite \u2014 you've unified us,\u201d she said. \"We are Boston strong, we are America strong, and choosing to mess with us was a terrible idea. So how's that for your VICTIM impact statement?\u201d'He is a leech'Several victims condemned Tsarnaev for coming to the U.S. as an immigrant from Russia, enjoying the benefits of living here and then attacking American citizens.\u201cHe is a leech, abusing the privilege of American freedom, and he spit in the face of the American dream,\u201d said Jennifer Rogers, an older sister of slain MIT Officer Sean Collier.Bill Richard, whose 8-year-old son, Martin, was the youngest person killed in the bombing, said Tsarnaev could have backed out of the plot and reported his brother to authorities. Instead, Richard said, \u201che chose hate. He chose destruction. He chose death. This is all on him.\u201dRichard noted that his family would have preferred that Tsarnaev receive a life sentence so that he could have had \u201ca lifetime to reconcile with himself what he did that day.\u201dRichard said his family has chosen love, kindness and peace, adding: \u201cThat is what makes us different than him.\u201dFatima Tlisova of VOA's Russian service contributed to this report from Boston.

{"doc_id": "TST3-WIKI-0003", "doctext": "There were ten times more air strikes in the covert war on terror during President Barack Obama\u2019s presidency than under his predecessor, George W. Bush.Obama embraced the US drone programme, overseeing more strikes in his first year than Bush carried out during his entire presidency. A total of 563 strikes, largely by drones, targeted Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen during Obama\u2019s two terms, compared to 57 strikes under Bush. Between 384 and 807 civilians were killed in those countries, according to reports logged by the Bureau.The use of drones aligned with Obama\u2019s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable, costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia. But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism.The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so \u201cexceptionally surgical and precise\u201d that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting \u201cinnocent men, women and children in danger\u201d. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau\u2019s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case.The White House released long-awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US\u2019s estimate of the number of civilians killed \u2013 between 64 and 116 \u2013 contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher.That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan \u2013 where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US bombardment, in an unreported war that saw 1,337 weapons dropped last year alone \u2013 a 40% rise on 2015.Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations (UN) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016. The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period. We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015.Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama\u2019s first term. The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush\u2019s term, after four years pocked by occasional strikes. However in the year after taking office, Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency. The 54 strikes in 2009 all took place in Pakistan.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.Unspecified", "Attacker": [], "Target": [["Pakistan", 337], ["Somalia", 347], ["Yemen", 359]], "Instrument": [["drones", 320]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["civilians", 446]], "Place": [["countries", 477]], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.Unspecified", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [["drone", 174]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["people", 1217]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.Unspecified", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [["drone", 174]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["civilians", 446]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [], "Place": [["battlefields", 1649]], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.Unspecified", "Attacker": [["US", 171]], "Target": [["Afghanistan", 1672]], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [["US", 171]], "Target": [["country", 1792]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["weapons", 1882]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["85", 2026]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["civilian", 446]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.Unspecified", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "Place": [["Pakistan", 337]]}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.Unspecified", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [["drone", 174]], "Place": []}]}
{"doc_id": "TST3-WIKI-0004", "doctext": "On 27 August 1975 a Provisional IRA bomb exploded without warning at the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey, England. There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off-duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing.==Background==In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven \"incident centres\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit (ASU) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974.==The bombing==The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign (Phase Two) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people.==Aftermath==One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \"carbon copy\" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences. The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property.==See also==*Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970\u201379)== References ==", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [["Caterham Arms public house", 73]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["bomb", 36]], "Place": [["Caterham", 73]]}, {"incident_type": "Life.Injure.Unspecified", "Victim": [["people", 162]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.Unspecified", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [["gun", 750], ["bomb", 36]], "Place": [["England", 121]]}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["bomb", 36]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Injure.Unspecified", "Victim": [["civilians", 1262], ["soldiers", 211]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [["IRA", 32]], "Target": [["Oxford Street", 1707]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["bomb", 36]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Injure.Unspecified", "Victim": [], "Injurer": [["people", 162]], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "ArtifactExistence.DamageDestroyDisableDismantle.Damage", "Damager": [], "Artifact": [["roof", 1487]], "Instrument": [], "Place": [["pub", 87]]}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["people", 162]], "Place": [], "Killer": [["unit", 621]], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Injure.Unspecified", "Victim": [["hundreds", 2300]], "Injurer": [["unit", 621]], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "ArtifactExistence.DamageDestroyDisableDismantle.Damage", "Damager": [["unit", 621]], "Artifact": [["property", 2358]], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Injure.Unspecified", "Victim": [["soldiers", 211]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.Unspecified", "Attacker": [["Their", 830]], "Target": [["Edward Heath", 911]], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [["attackers", 953]], "Target": [["he", 70]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["a bomb", 969]], "Place": [["bedroom", 985]]}, {"incident_type": "Life.Injure.Unspecified", "Victim": [["Some", 1385]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Injure.Unspecified", "Victim": [["soldiers", 211]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "ArtifactExistence.ManufactureAssemble.Unspecified", "ManufacturerAssembler": [["Balcombe Street Gang", 649]], "Artifact": [["bomb", 36]], "Components": [], "Instrument": [], "Place": [["house", 94]]}, {"incident_type": "Cognitive.Inspection.SensoryObserve", "Observer": [["centres", 441]], "ObservedEntity": [], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "ArtifactExistence.ManufactureAssemble.Unspecified", "ManufacturerAssembler": [["IRA", 32]], "Artifact": [["bomb", 36]], "Components": [], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Cognitive.Research.Unspecified", "Researcher": [["officers", 1777]], "Subject": [], "Means": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Justice.Sentence.Unspecified", "JudgeCourt": [], "Defendant": [["people", 162]], "Crime": [], "Sentence": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Justice.ArrestJailDetain.Unspecified", "Jailer": [], "Detainee": [["they", 2032]], "Crime": [], "Place": [["Balcombe Street", 649]]}, {"incident_type": "Contact.Contact.Unspecified", "Participant": [["Provisional Irish Republican Army", 298], ["government", 381], ["Northern Ireland Office", 400]], "Topic": [], "Place": []}]}
{"doc_id": "TST3-WIKI-0005", "doctext": "New York Gov.Andrew Cuomo (D) said Sunday that there is \u201cno evidence of an international terrorism connection\u201d in the explosion in Chelsea, though he stopped short of saying whoever caused the incident did not want to incite terror.AD\u201cIt depends on your definition of terrorism,\u201d Cuomo said.\u201cA bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism, but it\u2019s not linked to international terrorism.In other words, we find no ISIS connections.\u201dADHe said later: \u201cThis is the nightmare scenario.\u201dNot long after the blast, police said they had found another possible explosive device just blocks away.This device appeared to be similar to a pressure cooker and had wiring on it, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.Pressure cookers were used in the two bombs detonated at the Boston Marathon in 2013.The bomb squad safely removed the second device, New York police tweeted early Sunday.Police officers, firefighters and other first responders had rushed to the scene of the blast, which closed a major roadway and forced people out of nearby buildings.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said Sunday that the explosion was \u201cintentional,\u201d but noted that few details were available because the investigation was in its early stages.\u201cWe know there was a bombing,\u201d de Blasio said.\u201cWe know it was a very serious incident, but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this.\u201dADADHe also echoed his comments from Saturday night that there was no specific, credible threat against New York from any terrorist group.The FBI and NYPD are trying to understand what motivation lay behind the blast.\u201cWe will look at individuals.We will look at associations.We will look at social media,\u201d William Sweeney, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI New York Field Office, said.\u201cUntil we have that information it is not fair for us to give a conclusion [as to motivation],\u201d DeBlasio said.\u201cLet the law enforcement experts draw the conclusions.\u201dPolice Commissioner James O\u2019Neill, whose first day in the position was Saturday, told reporters on Sunday that police were still gathering evidence.AD\u201cWe did find some components indicative of an IED\u2026 that went off intentionally,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.Late Saturday, police had ruled out natural gas as a possible cause of the blast.ADThe New York Police Department\u2019s counterterrorism bureau responded to the explosion, along with officials with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.While O\u2019Neill said authorities were still trying to determine what, precisely, exploded, the NYPD counterterrorism bureau posted a photo online earlier Saturday showing what appeared to be a dumpster or garbage container mangled by a blast:Police in New York also reported shortly after 11 p.m. that they had found the \u201cpossible secondary device\u201d a few blocks away from the Chelsea explosion scene, on 27th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues.Police directed people away from that intersection, and one officer could be heard telling pedestrians that \u201cthere is a possible explosive\u201d in the area.ADNot long after midnight, police said in a statement that they were asking people in the area of this potential explosive to move away from their windows \u201cuntil we clear the suspicious package,\u201d although officers did not fully evacuate the area.ADAccording to the Associated Press, the second device was removed with a robot and taken to the department firing range in the Bronx.O\u2019Neill said Sunday that two \u201cvery dedicated\u201d former New York state troopers had responded to the initial report of the blast last night.In a search for other explosives, they had parked their vehicle on 27th Street.Walking down the block, they found the second, unexploded device, O\u2019Neill said.ADReports of another suspicious package at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue turned out to be a false alarm \u2014 the package was only garbage, J. Peter Donald, a police spokesman, posted on Twitter around 12:30 a.m. Sunday.The Chelsea explosion occurred about 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a Jersey Shore garbage can, shortly before a scheduled charity 5K race there benefiting Marines and Navy sailors.ADAuthorities have said they have not yet found anything connecting the Chelsea and New Jersey incidents but are continuing to investigate.On Sunday, Cuomo said the \u201cbombs\u201d in Chelsea \u201cappear to be different\u201d from those discovered earlier in the day in New Jersey, though the devices from both states were being shipped to the FBI lab in Quantico for further assessment.He said the devices in New Jersey were \u201cpipe bombs,\u201d and those in Chelsea were not.Cuomo said agents in New York were in touch with those in New Jersey.ADCuomo said officials \u201chave no reason to believe at this time that there is any further immediate threat,\u201d though the National Guard and the New York State Police were deploying an additional 1,000 personnel to bus terminals, airports and subways \u201cjust to err on the side of caution.\u201dADCuomo said the blast in Chelsea \u201ccaused significant property damage,\u201d though he a nearby subway station was structurally safe.He said law enforcement would work diligently to identify and locate those responsible.\u201cWhoever placed these bombs, we will find, and they will be brought to justice,\u201d Cuomo said.The explosion in the area of 23rd Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues occurred about 8:30 p.m. police said.Several of those injured were brought to area hospitals, Donald, the police spokesman, posted on Twitter.ADAll victims were treated and released by Sunday morning, Cuomo said.A spokeswoman for Lenox Health Greenwich Village, which treated nine of the victims, said patients were treated for minor injuries that included lacerations to the head and body.Other hospitals declined to provide specifics about the extent of patients\u2019 injuries from the explosion.ADPhotos and accounts posted on social media Saturday night showed large crowds \u2014 as well as a large law enforcement presence \u2014 in the area near where the explosion occurred.Soleil Filomena, 64, was leaving a convenience store at Seventh Avenue and 23rd Street when she heard the explosion.\u201cIt was so loud it just went through my whole body,\u201d she said.\u201cPeople started running up 23rd Street, and I started running with them.\u201dADFilomena said she saw a \u201cbig black cloud in the sky.\u201d After the explosion, she said her \u201cear was ringing for 15 minutes.\u201dWhen Keith Salomon of Delaware felt the explosion, he was having dinner a block and a half from the site of the blast.His chair and table shook, he said, and he saw people being taken away in ambulances.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what it was and so, at first, we just kept eating,\u201d said Salomon, 52, who was visiting his son in the city.\u201cBut then we realized something was wrong.\u201dOthers did not hear the explosion but saw the aftermath.When Jacob Schulman left his apartment a few blocks away shortly before 9 p.m., he saw people running and screaming.AD\u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going on, but everyone looked so panicked.I started running.too,\u201d said Schulman, 26, who has lived in the neighborhood since 2014.Two blocks from the blast scene, a group of people emerged from a screening of the animated movie \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and saw the flashing lights.One man who came out of the theater said he could not hear anything and had no idea about the explosion not far from where he was sitting.President Obama was briefed on the situation in New York and will be updated as more information becomes available, a White House official said late Saturday.Speaking in Colorado not long after the explosion, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump quickly commented on the situation before much information was known.\u201cI must tell you that just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Trump shortly after getting off of his plane.His comments were made before authorities confirmed the nature of the explosion.Late Saturday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said it was important to \u201cknow the facts\u201d before drawing conclusions about such incidents.Early Sunday, posts on social media from people in New York showed the area of the explosion to be relatively calm and quiet.Authorities had closed large swaths of roads in the area Saturday night.On Sunday, several roads had reopened but there remained a large police presence in the area.The explosion in New York comes as foreign leaders, including many heads of state, are heading to Manhattan for the United Nations General Assembly.Secretary of State John F. Kerry arrived Saturday, while Obama is scheduled to head to the city on Monday.This annual meeting \u2014 held more than two miles from the site of the explosion in Chelsea \u2014 is traditionally a challenging time for New York, as many roads are shut down and the heavy security leads to traffic jams.The FBI still has no determination as to motive, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.Agents are examining the detonated material from the first device as well as studying the second, which appeared to resemble a pressure cooker.They are also looking at video from security cameras, social media \u2014 \u201call the logical leads,\u201d the official said.The explosion in Chelsea coincided with a separate attack that took place in Minnesota Saturday night, in which a man stabbed eight people in a St.Cloud mall before he was killed by an off-duty police officer.On Sunday, an ISIS-linked news agency claimed the mall attacker was \u201ca soldier of the Islamic State.\u201dAn FBI spokesman said in an emailed statement that the agency had not determined whether the stabbings were related to the bombing in Manhattan the same night.Speaking to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday morning, New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie (R) said there were no known links so far between the incident in New Jersey and those in New York and Minnesota.Authorities urged any witnesses with tips, video or other credible information about the explosion to call 1-800-577-TIPS.Berman and Wang reported from Washington.Renae Merle in New York

{"doc_id": "TST3-WIKI-0006", "doctext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The threat from multiple homemade bombs detonated nearly simultaneously to kill or maim as many civilians as possible has been a hallmark of militant groups in recent years from Iraq to Israel and Afghanistan and Russia.But until Monday at the Boston Marathon finish line in Copley Square, such street-level bombings targeting sidewalk or marketplace crowds had not taken place on American soil.US law enforcement and intelligence officials across the country and overseas, scrambling to identify the source of the explosives, are now worried that the marathon sidewalk bombing could mark a new chapter in the struggle to secure the American homeland.Advertisement\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this around the world, but what is so concerning about this is that it hadn\u2019t happened here, not like this.Until yesterday,\u2019\u2019 said a senior homeland security official in Washington.The Boston bombs were packed into pressure cookers and hidden in backpacks or duffel bags, according to multiple press accounts citing unidentified sources, another similarity with some Mideast attacks using \u201cimprovised explosive devices,\u2019\u2019 or IEDs.One of the bombs used in a foiled attack in New York\u2019s Times Square in 2010 was fashioned from a pressure cooker.A joint warning issued by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in 2010 said pressure cookers has been used for bombs in multiple attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal.Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB\u2019s, nails, and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage.That contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in Oklahoma City in 1995 and in the garage of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1993, which were intended to inflict damage on buildings, as well as people.IED\u2019s pack a much smaller punch, are cheaper, and easier to carry.They have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan with devastating effect on American troops in convoys of military vehicles.AdvertisementNo one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on Boylston Street that killed three people and injured more than 150 near the Boston marathon finish line.A senior US law enforcement official in Washington added that the fact that no group has taken responsibility has officials speculating that it might not be the work of a well-known international terrorist group like Al Qaeda, Hezbollah or one of its affiliates but a domestic group or individual inspired by the hallmark tactics of terrorist groups in recent years,The Pakistani Taliban also said in a statement it was not responsible for the attack, unlike the attempted car bombing in New York\u2019s Times Square in 2010 that it claimed responsibility for.But officials in Washington have been warning about the possibility of so-called improvised explosive devises in recent weeks.In late february the White House established a new task force housed in the Department of Justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so-called improvised explosive devices \u2014 some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on Boylston Street yesterday.\u201cThe threat from IED use is likely to remain high in the near future, and will continue to evolve in response to our abilities to counter them,\u2019\u2019 according to a new strategy approved by President Obama on February 26.\u201cA whole-of-government approach that integrates Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and global participation in counter-IED activities will best position the United States to discover plots to use IEDs in the United States, or against U.S. persons abroad, before those threats become imminent.\u2019\u2019AdvertisementThe 2010 warning from the FBI and Homeland Security said \u201cterrorists can exploit the innocuous appearance of easily transportable items such as pressure cookers to conceal IED components.Placed carefully, such devices provide little or no indication of an impending attack.\u2019\u2019\u201cAlertness and quick reaction to discovery of such concealment devices in unusual locations or circumstances can improve chances of early detection and prevention of an attack,\u2019\u2019 the warning continued.Potential indicators of a pressure cooker configured as an IED include protruding wires or fuses, unusual smells such as chemical odors, and wetness or unusual stains on a container.A magazine published during the last decade by Al Qaeda provided bomb-making tips that included using pressure cookers.Instructions for building such bombs also are contained on other websites, including one site that bills itself as an \u201canarchist cookbook.\u2019\u2019", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [],

{"doc_id": "TST3-WIKI-0007", "doctext": "Accused New York City Bomber Pleads Not GuiltyAccused New York bomber Ahmad Khan Rahimi pleaded not guilty on Thursday to federal charges that he set off an explosive device in September on a crowded city street, injuring 30 people.Wearing a dark blue jump suit, Rahimi, 28, shuffled slowly into federal court in Manhattan and had several coughing fits during the brief hearing. He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing.He spoke only once, when U.S. District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight-count indictment filed on Wednesday.\"Yes, sir,\" Rahimi said.Prosecutors have accused the Afghan-born U.S. citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people.The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey, although that detonation did not injure anyone.Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey.In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey.He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed.Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi's movements on the day of the bombings, including leaving his house carrying bags, walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street.He also said the government has records showing Rahimi purchased bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs.Lewin asked Berman to consider a trial date in the \"late winter\" or \"early spring,\" saying the amount of evidence in the case is relatively limited. Berman scheduled court dates for Dec. 19 and Jan. 31 but has not set a trial date.Rahimi's court-appointed defense lawyers declined to comment after the hearing.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Justice.ChargeIndict.Unspecified", "Prosecutor": [], "Defendant": [["he", 143]], "JudgeCourt": [], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [["he", 143]], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["device", 167]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Injure.Unspecified", "Victim": [["people", 225]], "Injurer": [["he", 143]], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Justice.TrialHearing.Unspecified", "Prosecutor": [], "Defendant": [], "JudgeCourt": [["Manhattan", 313]], "Crime": [], "Place": [["court", 304]]}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [["Prosecutors", 651]], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["explosion", 723]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["anyone", 798]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Injure.Unspecified", "Victim": [["people", 225]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [["Rahimi", 81]], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Injure.Unspecified", "Victim": [["anyone", 798]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["devices", 1122]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Justice.ChargeIndict.Unspecified", "Prosecutor": [["prosecutors", 1023]], "Defendant": [["Rahimi", 81]], "JudgeCourt": [], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Justice.ArrestJailDetain.Unspecified", "Jailer": [["police", 427]], "Detainee": [["He", 379]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Injure.Unspecified", "Victim": [["him", 83]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [["Rahimi", 81]], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["device", 167]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Transaction.ExchangeBuySell.Unspecified", "Giver": [], "Recipient": [], "AcquiredEntity": [["bomb", 63]], "PaymentBarter": [], "Beneficiary": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Justice.TrialHearing.Unspecified", "Prosecutor": [], "Defendant": [["Rahimi", 81]], "JudgeCourt": [], "Crime": [], "Place": []}]}

Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's trip to Russia.Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with police last Thursday, while his younger brother Dzhokhar was captured a day later.Meanwhile, in Boston, authorities on Wednesday reopened Boylston Street, the city thoroughfare where the explosions occurred near the finish line of the race.Later, several thousand people gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a memorial service for campus policeman Sean Collier, who authorities say the Tsarnaev brothers shot to death three days after the bombings.Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano told the Senate Intelligence Committee that her agency did know about Tamerlan's trip, but that an FBI alert on him had expired by the time he returned.The FBI had interviewed Tsarnaev in 2011 at Russia's request, but found nothing to connect him to terrorism at that time.The 19-year-old Dzhokhar has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. He is in federal custody in a Boston hospital.U.S. officials say Dzhokhar told them in preliminary interviews that he and his brother were partly motivated by the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that they were self-radicalized and not connected to any terrorist network.

{"doc_id": "TST3-WIKI-0013", "doctext": "Thai Authorities Indict 2 Over August Shrine AttackA Bangkok military court has indicted two men accused of carrying out the August 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people.The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast, including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder.Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror, and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism.Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained. They are described as ethnic Uighurs, a minority group based in China's Xinjiang region. They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September.Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people-smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation.The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades, and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. Of the dead, 14 were tourists.The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry.Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others.The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb. Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived, said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai.Doubts about motiveEarly speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China, where it is feared they face persecution. The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists, who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing.But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive, sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human-smuggling gang. Still, skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks, contradictions, misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation.The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of \u201cnational security\u201d have been handled by the military since last May, when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government.Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed-circuit television footage, witnesses, DNA matching and physical evidence, in addition to their confessions.Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T-shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine, took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away. Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred, during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people.Police believe that Bilal is the yellow-shirted man who planted the bomb and Yusufu is believed to have detonated the bomb.Bilal, was initially identified as Adem Karadag, which was the name on a fake Turkish passport in his possession when he was arrested Aug. 29. He was arrested at one of two apartments police raided on the outskirts of Bangkok.Yusufu was arrested Sept. 1 near the Thai-Cambodia border, carrying a Chinese passport indicating he was from Xinjiang. Police said his DNA and fingerprints were found in both raided apartments, including on a container of gunpowder.Police said they have confessions from the two, and Bilal's lawyer says his client admitted planting the deadly bomb at the behest of another suspect who remains a fugitive.

{"doc_id": "TST3-WIKI-0014", "doctext": "Analysis backs claim drones were used to attack Venezuela\u2019s presidentAnalysis of open source information carried out by the investigative website Bellingcat suggests drones that had been repurposed as flying bombs were indeed used in an attack on the president of Venezuela this weekend.The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives.The president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred.Initial video from a state-owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro, those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera.But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions.AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim \u2014 suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat.Since then more footage has emerged, including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building.Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack, including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro\u2019s speech, and using frame-by-frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up.The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s, each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and, when detonated, capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters.DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model, normally used for industrial work \u2014 with a U.S. price tag of around $5,000 apiece, suggesting the attack could have cost little over $10k to carry out \u2014 with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially (for demolition purposes) at a cost of around $30.Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government\u2019s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600, noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors.It also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model, although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed.Venezuela\u2019s interior minister, Nestor Reverol, also claimed the government thwarted the attack using \"special techniques and [radio] signal inhibitors\", which \"disoriented\" the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand \u2014 a capability Bellingcat notes the Venezuelan security services are reported to have.The second drone was said by Reverol to have \"lost control\" and crashed into a nearby building.Bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion.It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed.\"It is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated, creating the hole in the wall of this apartment, igniting a fire, and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in Video 2 [of the state TV broadcast of Maduro\u2019s speech],\" it further suggests.Here\u2019s its conclusion:From the open sources of information available, it appears that an attack took place using two DBIEDs while Maduro was giving a speech.Both the drones appear visually similar to DJI Matrice 600s, with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model.These drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade.The first drone detonated somewhere above or near the parade, the most likely cause of the casualties announced by the Venezuelan government and pictured on social media.The second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage, and is the most likely cause of the fire which the Venezuelan firefighters described.It also considers the claim of attribution by a group on social media, calling itself \"Soldados de Franelas\" (aka \u2018T-Shirt Soldiers\u2019 \u2014 a reference to a technique used by protestors wrapping a t-shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity), suggesting it\u2019s not clear from the group\u2019s Twitter messages that they are \"unequivocally claiming responsibility for the event\", owing to use of passive language, and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government snipers \u2014 which it says \"does not appear to be supported by the open source information available\".", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.Unspecified", "Attacker": [],

Monday's toll was the highest since May 10, 2010, when 110 people were killed.The latest violence comes after the country suffered a spike in unrest in June when at least 282 people were killed, according to an AFP tally based on figures supplied by officials and medics, although government figures said 131 Iraqis died.Although those figures are markedly lower than during the peak of Iraq's communal bloodshed from 2006 to 2008, attacks remain common.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday's attacks, but al-Qaida's front group in Iraq has warned in recent days that it seeks to retake territory in the country.The Islamic State of Iraq warned in an audio message posted on various jihadist forums that it would begin targeting judges and prosecutors, and appealed for the help of Sunni tribes in its quest to recapture territory it once held.\"We are starting a new stage,\" said the voice on the message, purportedly that of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has been leader of the Islamic State of Iraq since May 2010.\"The first priority in this is releasing Muslim prisoners everywhere, and chasing and eliminating judges and investigators and their guards.\"It was not possible to verify whether the voice was that of Baghdadi.The speaker added: \"On the occasion of the beginning of the return of the state to the areas that we left, I urge you to carry out more efforts, and send your sons with the mujahedeen to defend your religion and obey God.\"", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.Unspecified", "Attacker": [["Iraq", 25], ["al-Qaida", 118]], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["people", 51]], "Place": [["Iraq", 25]], "Killer": [["al-Qaida", 118]], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [["responders", 536]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["bomb", 466], ["bombs", 466]], "Place": [["Taji", 562]]}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["people", 51]], "Place": [["Taji", 562]], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["woman", 998], ["baby", 1023], ["policeman", 1039]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [["houses", 887], ["victims", 1263]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["people", 51]], "Place": [["Baghdad", 1295]], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [["people", 51], ["others", 1472]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["bomb", 466]], "Place": [["Husseiniyah", 1942], ["Yarmouk", 1958], ["Baghdad", 1295], ["Tarmiyah", 2054]]}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [["people", 51], ["others", 1472]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["bomb", 466]], "Place": [["Diyala province", 2185]]}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.Unspecified", "Attacker": [["Insurgents", 2347]], "Target": [["military base", 2385]], "Instrument": [], "Place": [["Dhuluiyah", 2416]]}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["soldiers", 2453]], "Place": [], "Killer": [["Insurgents", 2347]], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Life.Injure.Unspecified", "Victim": [["others", 1472], ["Insurgents", 2347]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.Unspecified", "Attacker": [], "Target": [["people", 51]], "Instrument": [["bomb", 466]], "Place": [["mosque", 2628]]}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [["people", 51]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["bomb", 466]], "Place": [["Kirkuk city", 2787]]}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["bomb", 466]], "Place": [["Mosul", 2963], ["Baaj", 2992]]}, {"incident_type": "Life.Die.Unspecified", "Victim": [["people", 51]], "Place": [["Baaj", 2992], ["town", 554]], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [["patrol", 3361], ["soldier", 2453]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [["bomb", 466]], "Place": [["Heet", 3322]]}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "Attacker": [], "Target": [["people", 51]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": [["Iraq", 25]]}]}

Well, here it is in black and white. It\u2019s an admission. They have got to do something with this information.\u201dThe Birmingham pub bombings - The 28 numbers that add up to a cover-up, say campaignersMr Conway, now a criminal lawyer in Dublin, says in the book that where off-duty soldiers were the targets of bombings \u201cI had little sympathy for either the soldiers or the unfortunate civilians who had been sharing their drinking space.\u201dHe continued: \u201cThe Birmingham bombs were another matter.\"The bombings came after British police disrupted funeral arrangements for James McDade, a volunteer who had himself died in a premature explosion in England.\u201cTempers were high and I, for one, certainly at first feared that the local IRA had knowingly caused these dreadful casualties \u2013 21 people were killed and a great many others injured.\u201d\u201cI was appalled and personally ashamed of the bombing, which went against everything we claimed to stand for.\u201dHe said he told two other senior IRA figures, Dave O\u2019Connell and Kevin Mallon \u201cexactly what I thought\u201d when they met up.\u201cIn fact, both men were themselves furious, fully recognising not just the damage the bombing had caused to the IRA but its immorality as well.\u201dMcDade, a lieutenant in the Birmingham Brigade of the IRA, blew himself up while trying to plant a bomb at Coventry Telephone exchange a week before the pub bombings.Neither The Mulberry Bush nor The Tavern in The Town had any military connection.Normal IRA procedure at the time for any attack on non-military targets was to give a 30-minute warning in order for full evacuations to take place.Read our docudrama minute-by-minute recreation of the events of November 21 1974The Birmingham Mail received an ambiguous call at 8.11pm on November 21. The caller did not identify either pub, referring instead to The Rotunda, above The Mulberry Bush and the New Street Tax Office, which was above the underground Tavern in The Town.The first bomb destroyed The Mulberry Bush just six minutes later. The Tavern was destroyed at 8.27pm.Conway was not directly involved in the debrief with the England Operational Commander.But he said he was later told \u201cthat the early indications were that the casualties were the result of yet another failure in the warning system, a succession of phone boxes from which the warning might have been relayed having proved to be inoperable.\u201dIn an interview with a national newspaper he described the Birmingham pub bombings as \u201ca total disaster.\u201dHe added that the secret \u2018Feakle Talks\u2019, held a couple of weeks after the bombings, were used by the IRA to try to start to repair its image after the Birmingham and the Guildford pub bombings.The talks, in Feakle, County Clare, involved senior IRA officials and Protestant clergymen and ended abruptly after a tip-off that Irish Special Branch officers were on their way to arrest the republicans.But they set in train a process that eventually led to a brief ceasefire that began on December 22, 1974.Conway had been recruited in 1970, having been radicalised during the 1968 student protest movements.He met with senior republicans, including future deputy first minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams.Adams continues to deny that he was ever in the IRA.Conway was later jailed in Belfast\u2019s notorious Crumlin Road prison and went on hunger strike to achieve political status.Although he left the IRA in 1975, he rejoined during the 1981 hunger strike, then finally broke with the republican movement for good in 1993 when the British and Irish governments announced the Downing Street Declaration.He claimed the declaration basically reinforced partition.\u201cThe IRA went on ceasefire, it decommissioned and did all the things they said they would never do, and disappeared into history,\u201d he said.\u201cIt was a complete and utter defeat, absolutely.\u201dIn his book he also claims that rogue Irish police officers colluded with the IRA throughout the Troubles and that members of the Dublin establishment, including several mainstream politicians, aided the Provisionals in their armed campaign.* Southside

{"doc_id": "TST3-WIKI-0018", "doctext": "By MARI YAMAGUCHI, Associated PressTOKYO (AP) \u2014 Japanese police have arrested a man who admitted to landing a drone with low-level radioactive sand on the roof of the prime minister's office to protest the government's nuclear energy policy, officials said Saturday.Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto, 40, turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan.The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices, the prime ministers' office has said. The infiltration at Japan's political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there.No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident.Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister's office. He has not been indicted and faces further questioning.Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government's nuclear energy policy.Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan's 48 reactors, which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami-triggered Fukushima plant disaster. Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible.The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment.The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai-ichi meltdowns, NHK said.The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities. Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial, service and entertainment use. At a meeting Friday, task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones.It is not clear exactly when the drone landed because workers at the office in central Tokyo rarely go up to the roof. An official taking new employees on a building tour reportedly spotted the drone.A blog with an anti-nuclear theme managed under the name \"Kantei (prime minister's office) Santa\" contained photos of a drone that looked like the one found Wednesday. In one entry, the anonymous writer said he drove from his hometown in Obama city in Fukui to Tokyo and flew the drone in the early hours of April 9, trying to have it land in the yard of the prime minister's office, but that he eventually lost track of the device.In the United States in January, a drone flown by an off-duty intelligence employee crashed on the White House grounds.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Justice.ArrestJailDetain.Unspecified", "Jailer": [["police", 57]], "Detainee": [["man", 80]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Cognitive.IdentifyCategorize.Unspecified", "Identifier": [], "IdentifiedObject": [["drone", 110]], "IdentifiedRole": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Justice.ArrestJailDetain.Unspecified", "Jailer": [["Police", 765]], "Detainee": [["Yamamoto", 303]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack.Unspecified", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [["unmanned aerial devices", 501]], "Place": []}]}
