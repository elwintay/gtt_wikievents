made armored hum ##ve ##e vehicles captured from afghan forces as a car bomb in order to breach the military fortifications . a second source residing in maid ##an ward ##ak province said more than 100 members of national directorate of security ( n ##ds ) were killed in the complex attack . \" i have been in touch with the n ##ds official in the province and they told me that over 100 members of the n ##ds were killed in the big explosion , \" the former provincial official said . sharif hot ##ak , a member of the provincial council in maid ##an ward ##ak said he saw bodies of 35 afghan forces in the hospital . \" many more were killed . several bodies were transported to kabul city and many injured were transferred to hospitals in kabul , \" said hot ##ak , adding that \" the government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in the morale of the afghan forces . \" \" the explosion was very powerful . the whole building has collapsed , \" he said . government officials in maid ##an ward ##ak and kabul declined to comment when asked if they were ob ##scu ##ring the death toll . two senior officials in the interior ministry said the exact casualty figures were not being disclosed to prevent unrest within the armed forces . \" i have been told not to make the death toll figures public . it is frustrating to hide the facts , \" said a senior interior ministry official in kabul . a senior n ##ds official in kabul said at least 50 people were killed or wounded in the complex attack . abd ##ur ##rah ##man manga ##l , spokesman for the provincial governor in maid ##an ward ##ak said 12 people were killed and 12 were injured when the car bomb exploded near the afghan special forces unit . president ash ##raf g ##hani ' s office in a statement said the \" enemies of the country \" had carried out an attack against n ##ds personnel in maid ##an shah ##r . \" they killed and wounded a number of our beloved and honest sons . \" turkish president rec ##ep tay ##yi ##p [UNK] condemned the attack on monday evening and extended his condo ##lence ##s to g ##hani . meanwhile , the taliban said it met with u . s . officials in qatar on monday , in the latest round of talks between the insurgents and washington aimed at bringing an end to the 17 - year war . the u . s . has not officially commented on the reported meeting , which follows the last confirmed talks between the two parties in the uae in december . \" following american acceptance of the agenda of ending the occupation of afghanistan and preventing afghanistan from being used against other countries in the future , talks with american representatives took place today in doha , the capital of qatar , \" taliban spokesman za ##bi ##hul ##lah mu ##jah ##id said in a statement . taliban representatives have met several times with u . s . officials in recent months , but last week threatened to suspend the fledgling process , lamb ##ast ##ing washington for changing the agenda of the talks and \" un ##ila ##tera ##lly \" adding new subjects . the insurgents have long refused to hold direct talks with the kabul government - - despite u . s . pleas - - which the taliban dismiss ##es as a puppet of washington . in recent years the afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures . last year g ##hani has said 28 , 000 afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015 , breaking the long ##standing suppression on casualty data . taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack . za ##bi ##ulla ##h mu ##jah ##id , a spokesman for the hard ##line terrorist group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack . last week , taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 afghan ##s and ex ##pa ##tri ##ates in the capital , kabul . on sunday , a suicide bombing in the southeastern province of log ##ar left eight policemen dead and another 10 wounded . the taliban bombing targeted the provincial governor ' s convoy in mohammad ag ##ha district . the provincial governor and spy chief traveling in the convoy were unharmed . the taliban have ramp ##ed up their attacks on security forces and government facilities in recent months , while afghan and u . s . troops have increased operations against the militants ' field commanders . military sources say around 35 members of the country ' s security forces are killed every day in attacks and clashes . this is while the u . s . is still considering a significant troop draw ##down in afghanistan . around 14 , 000 u . s . troops are stationed in the country , coupled with around 7 , 500 troops from other allied nations , according to rand , a u . s . government research organization . in a report on sunday , rand said that if the u . s . considers \" an early and complete or near - complete departure unrelated to a negotiated peace settlement , \" it could push afghanistan into a civil war while the taliban would expand their control throughout the country . if the withdrawal does take place , rand noted , \" the major advances that afghan ##s have achieved in democracy , press freedom , human rights , women ' s emancipation , literacy , longevity , and living standards will be rolled back throughout the country . \"",

        "doctext": "new york gov . andrew cu ##omo ( d ) said sunday that there is \u201c no evidence of an international terrorism connection \u201d in the explosion in chelsea , though he stopped short of saying whoever caused the incident did not want to inc ##ite terror . ad \u201c it depends on your definition of terrorism , \u201d cu ##omo said . \u201c a bomb exploding in new york is obviously an act of terrorism , but it \u2019 s not linked to international terrorism . in other words , we find no isis connections . \u201d ad ##he said later : \u201c this is the nightmare scenario . \u201d not long after the blast , police said they had found another possible explosive device just blocks away . this device appeared to be similar to a pressure cooke ##r and had wiring on it , according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of an ##ony ##mity to discuss the ongoing investigation . pressure cooke ##rs were used in the two bombs detonated at the boston marathon in 2013 . the bomb squad safely removed the second device , new york police t ##wee ##ted early sunday . police officers , firefighters and other first respond ##ers had rushed to the scene of the blast , which closed a major roadway and forced people out of nearby buildings . new york mayor bill de b ##las ##io ( d ) said sunday that the explosion was \u201c intentional , \u201d but noted that few details were available because the investigation was in its early stages . \u201c we know there was a bombing , \u201d de b ##las ##io said . \u201c we know it was a very serious incident , but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this . \u201d ada ##dh ##e also echoed his comments from saturday night that there was no specific , credible threat against new york from any terrorist group . the fbi and ny ##pd are trying to understand what motivation lay behind the blast . \u201c we will look at individuals . we will look at associations . we will look at social media , \u201d william sweeney , assistant director in charge of the fbi new york field office , said . \u201c until we have that information it is not fair for us to give a conclusion [ as to motivation ] , \u201d de ##bla ##sio said . \u201c let the law enforcement experts draw the conclusions . \u201d police commissioner james o \u2019 neill , whose first day in the position was saturday , told reporters on sunday that police were still gathering evidence . ad \u201c we did find some components indicative of an ie ##d \u2026 that went off intentionally , \u201d o \u2019 neill said . late saturday , police had ruled out natural gas as a possible cause of the blast . ad ##the new york police department \u2019 s counter ##ter ##ror ##ism bureau responded to the explosion , along with officials with the fbi and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives . while o \u2019 neill said authorities were still trying to determine what , precisely , exploded , the ny ##pd counter ##ter ##ror ##ism bureau posted a photo online earlier saturday showing what appeared to be a dump ##ster or garbage container man ##gled by a blast : police in new york also reported shortly after 11 p . m . that they had found the \u201c possible secondary device \u201d a few blocks away from the chelsea explosion scene , on 27th street between sixth and seventh avenues . police directed people away from that intersection , and one officer could be heard telling pedestrians that \u201c there is a possible explosive \u201d in the area . ad ##not long after midnight , police said in a statement that they were asking people in the area of this potential explosive to move away from their windows \u201c until we clear the suspicious package , \u201d although officers did not fully evacuate the area . ada ##cco ##rdi ##ng to the associated press , the second device was removed with a robot and taken to the department firing range in the bronx . o \u2019 neill said sunday that two \u201c very dedicated \u201d former new york state troopers had responded to the initial report of the blast last night . in a search for other explosives , they had parked their vehicle on 27th street . walking down the block , they found the second , une ##x ##pl ##ode ##d device , o \u2019 neill said . ad ##re ##ports of another suspicious package at 28th street and fifth avenue turned out to be a false alarm \u2014 the package was only garbage , j . peter donald , a police spokesman , posted on twitter around 12 : 30 a . m . sunday . the chelsea explosion occurred about 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a jersey shore garbage can , shortly before a scheduled charity 5 ##k race there benefit ##ing marines and navy sailors . ada ##uth ##ori ##ties have said they have not yet found anything connecting the chelsea and new jersey incidents but are continuing to investigate . on sunday , cu ##omo said the \u201c bombs \u201d in chelsea \u201c appear to be different \u201d from those discovered earlier in the day in new jersey , though the devices from both states were being shipped to the fbi lab in quan ##tic ##o for further assessment . he said the devices in new jersey were \u201c pipe bombs , \u201d and those in chelsea were not . cu ##omo said agents in new york were in touch with those in new jersey . ad ##cu ##omo said officials \u201c have no reason to believe at this time that there is any further immediate threat , \u201d though the national guard and the new york state police were deploy ##ing an additional 1 , 000 personnel to bus terminals , airports and subway ##s \u201c just to er ##r on the side of caution . \u201d ad ##cu ##omo said the blast in chelsea \u201c caused significant property damage , \u201d though he a nearby subway station was structurally safe . he said law enforcement would work dil ##igen ##tly to identify and locate those responsible . \u201c whoever placed these bombs , we will find , and they will be brought to justice , \u201d cu ##omo said . the explosion in the area of 23rd street between sixth and seventh avenues occurred about 8 : 30 p . m . police said . several of those injured were brought to area hospitals , donald , the police spokesman , posted on twitter . ada ##ll victims were treated and released by sunday morning , cu ##omo said . a spoke ##sw ##oman for len ##ox health greenwich village , which treated nine of the victims , said patients were treated for minor injuries that included lace ##rations to the head and body . other hospitals declined to provide specific ##s about the extent of patients \u2019 injuries from the explosion . ad ##ph ##oto ##s and accounts posted on social media saturday night showed large crowds \u2014 as well as a large law enforcement presence \u2014 in the area near where the explosion occurred . sole ##il fi ##lom ##ena , 64 , was leaving a convenience store at seventh avenue and 23rd street when she heard the explosion . \u201c it was so loud it just went through my whole body , \u201d she said . \u201c people started running up 23rd street , and i started running with them . \u201d ad ##fi ##lom ##ena said she saw a \u201c big black cloud in the sky . \u201d after the explosion , she said her \u201c ear was ringing for 15 minutes . \u201d when keith sal ##omo ##n of delaware felt the explosion , he was having dinner a block and a half from the site of the blast . his chair and table shook , he said , and he saw people being taken away in ambulance ##s . \u201c we didn \u2019 t know what it was and so , at first , we just kept eating , \u201d said sal ##omo ##n , 52 , who was visiting his son in the city . \u201c but then we realized something was wrong . \u201d others did not hear the explosion but saw the aftermath . when jacob sc ##hul ##man left his apartment a few blocks away shortly before 9 p . m . , he saw people running and screaming . ad \u201c i didn \u2019 t know what was going on , but everyone looked so panicked . i started running . too , \u201d said sc ##hul ##man , 26 , who has lived in the neighborhood since 2014 . two blocks from the blast scene , a group of people emerged from a screening of the animated movie \u201c beauty and the beast \u201d and saw the flashing lights . one man who came out of the theater said he could not hear anything and had no idea about the explosion not far from where he was sitting . president obama was brief ##ed on the situation in new york and will be updated as more information becomes available , a white house official said late saturday . speaking in colorado not long after the explosion , republican presidential nominee donald trump quickly commented on the situation before much information was known . \u201c i must tell you that just before i got off the plane , a bomb went off in new york and nobody knows exactly what \u2019 s going on , \u201d said trump shortly after getting off of his plane . his comments were made before authorities confirmed the nature of the explosion . late saturday , democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton said it was important to \u201c know the facts \u201d before drawing conclusions about such incidents . early sunday , posts on social media from people in new york showed the area of the explosion to be relatively calm and quiet . authorities had closed large swat ##hs of roads in the area saturday night . on sunday , several roads had reopened but there remained a large police presence in the area . the explosion in new york comes as foreign leaders , including many heads of state , are heading to manhattan for the united nations general assembly . secretary of state john f . kerry arrived saturday , while obama is scheduled to head to the city on monday . this annual meeting \u2014 held more than two miles from the site of the explosion in chelsea \u2014 is traditionally a challenging time for new york , as many roads are shut down and the heavy security leads to traffic jam ##s . the fbi still has no determination as to motive , said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of an ##ony ##mity because the investigation is ongoing . agents are examining the detonated material from the first device as well as studying the second , which appeared to resemble a pressure cooke ##r . they are also looking at video from security cameras , social media \u2014 \u201c all the logical leads , \u201d the official said . the explosion in chelsea coincided with a separate attack that took place in minnesota saturday night , in which a man stabbed eight people in a st . cloud mall before he was killed by an off - duty police officer . on sunday , an isis - linked news agency claimed the mall attacker was \u201c a soldier of the islamic state . \u201d an fbi spokesman said in an email ##ed statement that the agency had not determined whether the stabbing ##s were related to the bombing in manhattan the same night . speaking to cnn \u2019 s jake tap ##per on sunday morning , new jersey gov . chris christie ( r ) said there were no known links so far between the incident in new jersey and those in new york and minnesota . authorities urged any witnesses with tips , video or other credible information about the explosion to call 1 - 800 - 57 ##7 - tips . berman and wang reported from washington . ren ##ae mer ##le in new york and karen de ##you ##ng , ellen nak ##ashi ##ma , steven overly and sar ##i ho ##r ##witz in washington contributed to this report .

        "doctext": "washington \u2014 the threat from multiple homemade bombs detonated nearly simultaneously to kill or mai ##m as many civilians as possible has been a hallmark of militant groups in recent years from iraq to israel and afghanistan and russia . but until monday at the boston marathon finish line in cop ##ley square , such street - level bombings targeting sidewalk or marketplace crowds had not taken place on american soil . us law enforcement and intelligence officials across the country and overseas , scrambling to identify the source of the explosives , are now worried that the marathon sidewalk bombing could mark a new chapter in the struggle to secure the american homeland . advertisement \u201c we \u2019 ve seen this around the world , but what is so concerning about this is that it hadn \u2019 t happened here , not like this . until yesterday , \u2019 \u2019 said a senior homeland security official in washington . the boston bombs were packed into pressure cooke ##rs and hidden in backpack ##s or duff ##el bags , according to multiple press accounts citing unidentified sources , another similarity with some mid ##ea ##st attacks using \u201c improvised explosive devices , \u2019 \u2019 or ie ##ds . one of the bombs used in a foil ##ed attack in new york \u2019 s times square in 2010 was fashioned from a pressure cooke ##r . a joint warning issued by the fbi and the department of homeland security in 2010 said pressure cooke ##rs has been used for bombs in multiple attacks in afghanistan , pakistan , india , and nepal . reports from medical staff at boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with bb \u2019 s , nails , and other projectile ##s intended to maximize human carnage . that contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in oklahoma city in 1995 and in the garage of the world trade center north tower in 1993 , which were intended to in ##flict damage on buildings , as well as people . ie ##d \u2019 s pack a much smaller punch , are cheaper , and easier to carry . they have been used in iraq and afghanistan with devastating effect on american troops in convoys of military vehicles . advertisement ##no one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on boy ##lston street that killed three people and injured more than 150 near the boston marathon finish line . a senior us law enforcement official in washington added that the fact that no group has taken responsibility has officials spec ##ulating that it might not be the work of a well - known international terrorist group like al qaeda , hezbollah or one of its affiliates but a domestic group or individual inspired by the hallmark tactics of terrorist groups in recent years , the pakistani taliban also said in a statement it was not responsible for the attack , unlike the attempted car bombing in new york \u2019 s times square in 2010 that it claimed responsibility for . but officials in washington have been warning about the possibility of so - called improvised explosive devi ##ses in recent weeks . in late february the white house established a new task force housed in the department of justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so - called improvised explosive devices \u2014 some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on boy ##lston street yesterday . \u201c the threat from ie ##d use is likely to remain high in the near future , and will continue to evolve in response to our abilities to counter them , \u2019 \u2019 according to a new strategy approved by president obama on february 26 . \u201c a whole - of - government approach that integrate ##s federal , state , local , tribal , territorial , private sector , and global participation in counter - ie ##d activities will best position the united states to discover plots to use ie ##ds in the united states , or against u . s . persons abroad , before those threats become imminent . \u2019 \u2019 advertisement ##the 2010 warning from the fbi and homeland security said \u201c terrorists can exploit the inn ##oc ##uous appearance of easily transport ##able items such as pressure cooke ##rs to conceal ie ##d components . placed carefully , such devices provide little or no indication of an impending attack . \u2019 \u2019 \u201c alert ##ness and quick reaction to discovery of such conceal ##ment devices in unusual locations or circumstances can improve chances of early detection and prevention of an attack , \u2019 \u2019 the warning continued . potential indicators of a pressure cooke ##r configured as an ie ##d include protruding wires or fuse ##s , unusual smells such as chemical odor ##s , and wet ##ness or unusual stains on a container . a magazine published during the last decade by al qaeda provided bomb - making tips that included using pressure cooke ##rs . instructions for building such bombs also are contained on other websites , including one site that bills itself as an \u201c anarchist cook ##book . \u2019 \u2019",

        "doctext": "thai authorities ind ##ic ##t 2 over august shrine attack ##a bangkok military court has indicted two men accused of carrying out the august 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people . the court on tuesday indicted bi ##lal mohammed and mi ##era ##ili yusuf ##u on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit prem ##ed ##itated murder . thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of era ##wan shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . police issued 17 arrest warrant ##s following the bombing but only bi ##lal and mi ##era ##ili have been detained . they are described as ethnic ui ##gh ##urs , a minority group based in china ' s xinjiang region . they have been held in custody since their arrests in late august and early september . thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . the august 17 blast at the era ##wan shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . of the dead , 14 were tourists . the attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent random ##ness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . arrest warrant ##s have been issued for 15 others . the two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison ga ##rb . members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictment ##s took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer chu ##cha ##rt kan ##pa ##i . doubts about motive ##ear ##ly speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of ui ##gh ##ur sep ##arat ##ists who were angry that thailand in july forcibly rep ##at ##riated more than 100 ui ##gh ##urs to china , where it is feared they face persecution . the theory was bo ##lster ##ed by the fact that the era ##wan shrine is popular among chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . but thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupt ##ing a human - smuggling gang . still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has ab ##ounded because of leaks , contradiction ##s , miss ##tate ##ments and secrecy surrounding the investigation . the two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in bangkok because cases of \u201c national security \u201d have been handled by the military since last may , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government . former national police chief so ##my ##ot po ##omp ##han ##mu ##ang said before his retirement in september that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage , witnesses , dna matching and physical evidence , in addition to their confessions . security camera footage from the era ##wan shrine showed a man wearing a yellow t - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine , took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away . time stamps on closed circuit tv footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred , during evening rush hour as the area in central bangkok was filled with people . police believe that bi ##lal is the yellow - shirt ##ed man who planted the bomb and yusuf ##u is believed to have detonated the bomb . bi ##lal , was initially identified as ad ##em kara ##da ##g , which was the name on a fake turkish passport in his possession when he was arrested aug . 29 . he was arrested at one of two apartments police raided on the outskirts of bangkok . yusuf ##u was arrested sept . 1 near the thai - cambodia border , carrying a chinese passport indicating he was from xinjiang . police said his dna and fingerprints were found in both raided apartments , including on a container of gunpowder . police said they have confessions from the two , and bi ##lal ' s lawyer says his client admitted planting the deadly bomb at the be ##hes ##t of another suspect who remains a fugitive . he says bi ##lal was induced to carry out the action by a promise that his emigration to turkey would be ex ##ped ##ited . some material for this report came from ap .",

owned television network showed the reaction of mad ##uro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . but the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . ap also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim \u2014 suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . since then more footage has emerged , including videos pu ##rp ##ort ##ing to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . bell ##ing ##cat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including sync ##ing timing ##s of the state broadcast of mad ##uro \u2019 s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of caracas to try to pin ##point locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . the venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were dj ##i mat ##rice 600 ##s , each carrying approximately 1 ##k ##g of c ##4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . dj ##i mat ##rice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work \u2014 with a u . s . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 api ##ece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10 ##k to carry out \u2014 with 1 ##k ##g of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . bell ##ing ##cat says its analysis supports the government \u2019 s claim that the drone model used was a dj ##i mat ##rice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotor ##s . it also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model , although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed . venezuela \u2019 s interior minister , nestor rev ##ero ##l , also claimed the government thwarted the attack using \" special techniques and [ radio ] signal inhibitors \" , which \" di ##sor ##iente ##d \" the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand \u2014 a capability bell ##ing ##cat notes the venezuelan security services are reported to have . the second drone was said by rev ##ero ##l to have \" lost control \" and crashed into a nearby building . bell ##ing ##cat says it is possible to geo ##lo ##cate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas can ##ister explosion . it adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed . \" it is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated , creating the hole in the wall of this apartment , ign ##iting a fire , and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in video 2 [ of the state tv broadcast of mad ##uro \u2019 s speech ] , \" it further suggests . here \u2019 s its conclusion : from the open sources of information available , it appears that an attack took place using two db ##ied ##s while mad ##uro was giving a speech . both the drones appear visually similar to dj ##i mat ##rice 600 ##s , with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model . these drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade . the first drone detonated somewhere above or near the parade , the most likely cause of the casualties announced by the venezuelan government and pictured on social media . the second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage , and is the most likely cause of the fire which the venezuelan firefighters described . it also considers the claim of at ##tri ##bution by a group on social media , calling itself \" sold ##ados de fran ##ela ##s \" ( aka \u2018 t - shirt soldiers \u2019 \u2014 a reference to a technique used by protest ##ors wrapping a t - shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity ) , suggesting it \u2019 s not clear from the group \u2019 s twitter messages that they are \" une ##qui ##vo ##cal ##ly claiming responsibility for the event \" , owing to use of passive language , and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government sniper ##s \u2014 which it says \" does not appear to be supported by the open source information available \" .",

        "doctext": "a wave of attacks across iraq on monday killed 107 people in the country ' s dead ##liest day in more than two years after al - q ##aid ##a warned it would mount new attacks and sought to re ##take territory . officials said at least 214 people were wounded in 27 different attacks launched in 18 cities , shattering a relative calm which had held in the lead - up to the start on saturday of the holy muslim fast ##ing month of rama ##dan . in monday ' s dead ##liest attack - - a string of roadside bombs and a car bomb followed by a suicide attack targeting emergency respond ##ers in the town of ta ##ji - - at least 42 people were killed and 40 wounded , according to two medical officials . \" i heard explosions in the distance so i left my house and i saw a car outside , \" said 40 - year - old ta ##ji resident abu mohammed , who added that police inspectors concluded the vehicle was a car bomb . \" we asked the neighbors to leave their houses , but when they were leaving , the bomb went off . \" abu mohammed said he witnessed the deaths of an elderly woman carrying a newborn baby and of the policeman who had first concluded the car was packed with explosives . an age ##nce france press ##e reporter at the scene said a row of houses were completely destroyed , and residents were rum ##ma ##ging through the rubble in search of victims and their belongings . in baghdad , meanwhile , a car bomb outside a government office responsible for producing identity papers in the shi ##ite bastion of sad ##r city killed at least 12 people and wounded 22 others , security and medical officials said . \" this attack is a terrible crime against humanity , because they did it during rama ##dan , while people are fast ##ing , \" said one elderly witness who declined to be identified . an af ##p journalist said eight nearby cars were badly burned and many of the victims of the 9 : 30 am ( 06 ##30 gm ##t ) attack could not be identified because their papers were inside the offices that were targeted . two other explosions in the baghdad neighborhoods of hussein ##iya ##h and ya ##rm ##ouk killed at least four people and left 24 others wounded , while a car bomb in the town of tar ##miya ##h , just north of baghdad , hurt nine people , officials said . checkpoint shooting ##s and bomb blasts in rest ##ive ethnic ##ally - mixed di ##yala province killed 11 people and left 40 others wounded , security officials and doctor ahmed ibrahim from the main hospital in provincial capital ba ##qu ##ba said . insurgents also launched attacks on a military base near the town of dh ##ulu ##iya ##h , killing at least 15 iraqi soldiers and leaving two others wounded , according to two security officials . two other attacks in the same province - - a shooting at a checkpoint and a car bomb near a shi ##ite mosque - - left three people dead and six wounded , officials said . nine bomb blasts , some of them minutes apart , meanwhile killed seven people and wounded 29 in kirk ##uk city and the eponymous province ' s towns of di ##bis and tu ##z k ##hur ##mat ##u . three different attacks - - a car bomb , a roadside blast and a shooting - - in the main northern city of mo ##sul and the nearby town of ba ##aj left nine people dead and seven wounded , according to iraqi army first lieutenant wa ##ad mohammed and police lieutenant mohammed al - ju ##bu ##ri . a roadside bomb at a market in the center of the town of di ##wani ##yah , south of baghdad , killed three people and left 25 hurt , provincial health chief ad ##nan turk ##i said . in the western town of hee ##t , a car bomb exploded near an army patrol , killing one soldier and wounding 10 others , according to an iraqi army captain and doctor abdul ##wa ##hab al - sham ##mar ##i from the town hospital . the attacks came a day after a spat ##e of bombings across iraq killed at least 17 people and wounded nearly 100 others . monday ' s toll was the highest since may 10 , 2010 , when 110 people were killed . the latest violence comes after the country suffered a spike in unrest in june when at least 282 people were killed , according to an af ##p tally based on figures supplied by officials and med ##ics , although government figures said 131 iraqi ##s died . although those figures are markedly lower than during the peak of iraq ' s communal blood ##shed from 2006 to 2008 , attacks remain common . there was no immediate claim of responsibility for monday ' s attacks , but al - q ##aid ##a ' s front group in iraq has warned in recent days that it seeks to re ##take territory in the country . the islamic state of iraq warned in an audio message posted on various jihad ##ist forums that it would begin targeting judges and prosecutors , and appealed for the help of sunni tribes in its quest to recapture territory it once held . \" we are starting a new stage , \" said the voice on the message , purported ##ly that of abu ba ##kr al - baghdad ##i , who has been leader of the islamic state of iraq since may 2010 . \" the first priority in this is releasing muslim prisoners everywhere , and chasing and eliminating judges and investigators and their guards . \" it was not possible to verify whether the voice was that of baghdad ##i . the speaker added : \" on the occasion of the beginning of the return of the state to the areas that we left , i urge you to carry out more efforts , and send your sons with the mu ##jah ##ede ##en to defend your religion and obey god . \"",

gathering department in the 1970s , broke a 40 - year silence by the organisation to make the admission . he admitted he was \u201c appalled and ashamed \u201d because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for . he said the attacks on the mu ##lb ##erry bush and the tavern in the town had been in revenge for the death of ira bomber james mc ##dad ##e . at first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because \u201c temper ##s were high \u201d . but he was later told that the ira unit involved had tried to use \u201c a succession of phone boxes \u201d which were out of order , significantly delaying the bomb -

brief and to assess the impact of the disaster as far as the terrorists were concerned . birmingham pub bombings : minute by minute - 24 hours that changed our city forever ##fu ##nding for the terrorists dried up almost overnight and the bombings , which left 21 dead and almost 200 injured , including many mai ##med for life , cost them hugely in the propaganda war . and in an interview he confirmed that the ira hierarchy in dublin knew all along that the six irish ##men arrested for the explosions were innocent \u201c from the get go , from the very start . \u201d now , julie and brian ham ##ble ##ton , who lost their sister maxi ##ne in the bombings and lead the city \u2019 s justice ##4th ##e ##21 campaign , called on west midlands police and david cameron to take immediate action . julie said : \u201c i am expecting west midlands police chief constable chris sims and west midlands police force to interview with mr conway with immediate effect . \u201c and i hope that mr cameron , who a week ago told the house of commons that the pub bombers must be found , takes note of this development and ensures that the police follow this through . \u201d brian added : \u201c the police keep saying they won \u2019 t do anything because there is no fresh evidence . well , here it is in black and white . it \u2019 s an admission . they have got to do something with this information . \u201d the birmingham pub bombings - the 28 numbers that add up to a cover - up , say campaign ##ers ##m ##r conway , now a criminal lawyer in dublin , says in the book that where off - duty soldiers were the targets of bombings \u201c i had little sympathy for either the soldiers or the unfortunate civilians who had been sharing their drinking space . \u201d he continued : \u201c the birmingham bombs were another matter . \" the bombings came after british police disrupted funeral arrangements for james mc ##dad ##e , a volunteer who had himself died in a premature explosion in england . \u201c temper ##s were high and i , for one , certainly at first feared that the local ira had knowing ##ly caused these dreadful casualties \u2013 21 people were killed and a great many others injured . \u201d \u201c i was appalled and personally ashamed of the bombing , which went against everything we claimed to stand for . \u201d he said he told two other senior ira figures , dave o \u2019 connell and kevin mall ##on \u201c exactly what i thought \u201d when they met up . \u201c in fact , both men were themselves furious , fully rec ##og ##nis ##ing not just the damage the bombing had caused to the ira but its im ##moral ##ity as well . \u201d mc ##dad ##e , a lieutenant in the birmingham brigade of the ira , blew himself up while trying to plant a bomb at coventry telephone exchange a week before the pub bombings . neither the mu ##lb ##erry bush nor the tavern in the town had any military connection . normal ira procedure at the time for any attack on non - military targets was to give a 30 - minute warning in order for full evacuation ##s to take place . read our doc ##ud ##rama minute - by - minute recreation of the events of november 21 1974 ##the birmingham mail received an ambiguous call at 8 . 11 ##pm on november 21 . the caller did not identify either pub , referring instead to the rot ##unda , above the mu ##lb ##erry bush and the new street tax office , which was above the underground tavern in the town . the first bomb destroyed the mu ##lb ##erry bush just six minutes later . the tavern was destroyed at 8 . 27 ##pm . conway was not directly involved in the de ##bri ##ef with the england operational commander . but he said he was later told \u201c that the early indications were that the casualties were the result of yet another failure in the warning system , a succession of phone boxes from which the warning might have been relay ##ed having proved to be in ##oper ##able . \u201d in an interview with a national newspaper he described the birmingham pub bombings as \u201c a total disaster . \u201d he added that the secret \u2018 fe ##ak ##le talks \u2019 , held a couple of weeks after the bombings , were used by the ira to try to start to repair its image after the birmingham and the guildford pub bombings . the talks , in fe ##ak ##le , county clare , involved senior ira officials and protestant clergy ##men and ended abruptly after a tip - off that irish special branch officers were on their way to arrest the republicans . but they set in train a process that eventually led to a brief ceasefire that began on december 22 , 1974 . conway had been recruited in 1970 , having been radical ##ised during the 1968 student protest movements . he met with senior republicans , including future deputy first minister of northern ireland martin mc ##gui ##nne ##ss and sinn fein president gerry adams . adams continues to deny that he was ever in the ira . conway was later jailed in belfast \u2019 s notorious cr ##um ##lin road prison and went on hunger strike to achieve political status . although he left the ira in 1975 , he rejoined during the 1981 hunger strike , then finally broke with the republican movement for good in 1993 when the british and irish governments announced the downing street declaration . he claimed the declaration basically reinforced partition . \u201c the ira went on ceasefire , it decommissioned and did all the things they said they would never do , and disappeared into history , \u201d he said . \u201c it was a complete and utter defeat , absolutely . \u201d in his book he also claims that rogue irish police officers col ##lu ##ded with the ira throughout the troubles and that members of the dublin establishment , including several mainstream politicians , aided the provisional ##s in their armed campaign . * south ##side provisional : from freedom fighter to the four courts is published by or ##pen press .",
