{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0003", "doctext": "amid speculation that president bush is reconsidering what will constitute \"regime change in iraq,\" one thing should be clear: saddam hussein's willingness to \"change\" his attitude towards permitting the resumption of intrusive on-site u.n. weapons inspections will not, in fact, eliminate the danger posed by him and his ruling clique.indeed, what would be, at best, an ephemeral attitudinal adjustment on saddam's part would probably not even diminish meaningfully the threat from iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. after all, were saddam -- against all odds and past practice -- actually to cooperate with the u.n. inspectors and assist in the complete elimination of his chemical and biological arsenals, he could resume covertly stockpiling them again in as little as six-months time.that period could be still shorter if he were to be rewarded for his \"cooperation\" by the elimination of international economic and trade sanctions against iraq.a news item published in the london evening standard last monday provides, however, an important reminder of why the united states cannot safely accept any substitute for the toppling of saddam's regime.specifically, it summarizes evidence implicating saddam hussein in one or more deadly acts of terror against the united states, specifically the oklahoma city bombing.the standard article draws on investigative reporting and forensic analysis into the oklahoma city bombing performed over the past seven years by an intrepid and tenacious former tv journalist, jayna davis. she offers compelling, if circumstantial, indications that iraqi operatives helped to plot, prepare and execute murderous attacks in oklahoma city (and perhaps against other targets in the united states).for example, ms. davis has identified a man whose photo matches that of a \"john doe #2\" sought immediately after the murrah building attack. he appears to be a palestinian by the name of hussain hashem al hussaini, who sported a tatoo suggesting he had served in saddam's elite republican guard.according to davis' evidence, witnesses put al hussaini in the company of confessed bomber timothy mcveigh a few days before the attack and near the site immediately beforehand. ms. davis has also found witnesses who say mcveigh and his convicted co-conspirator, terry nichols, had consorted with former iraqi soldiers. some of these former soldiers worked for a palestinian who owned a truck very like one sought after the attack. these soldiers reportedly were absent from work on the day of the bombing and were seen celebrating after it occurred. it strains credulity that all of these dots are not connected.what is more, ms. davis' evidence appears consistent with findings by another investigator, dr. laurie mylroie, who has devoted years of effort to the pursuit of iraqi connections to the earlier world trade center bombing. like ms. davis, dr. mylroie concludes that saddam's modus operandi is to employ cut-outs to cover his tracks.according to this thesis, the first attempt aimed at destroying the twin towers was not exclusively accomplished by followers of a blind egyptian sheik with ties to iran. this conclusion was actually a bonus for hussein, because it vectored blame at iran, his most formidable enemy and neighbor. similarly, oklahoma city was not, as prosecutors claimed, simply the homegrown handiwork of two violently disaffected u.s. citizens.and sept. 11 was not the product solely of usama bin laden's al qaeda network. in each of these cases, there is reason to believe that saddam hussein and his minions played some role in the murder of americans.to be sure, it is not exactly news that ms. davis has concluded that iraqi operatives were involved in oklahoma city. what is news is that, according to the evening standard, the bush justice department has apparently, finally begun to take a serious interest in ms. davis' evidence.such evidence simply serves strongly to reinforce a reality of which president bush has long and repeatedly warned: we will enjoy no relief from saddam's predations unless and until he and his ilk are removed from power in iraq.the memory of those americans who have already been murdered by the butcher of baghdad and his co-conspirators will be besmirched -- and the fate of untold numbers of their countrymen recklessly jeopardized -- if a temporary adjustment to saddam's behavior on inspections were to be confused with, and allowed to substitute for, the needed elimination of his regime.frank

loaded with explosives flew towards the president while he was speaking at a military parade in caracas.but many are now wondering: who could have been behind the attack?foreign powersaccording to maduro, the plot was concocted by an international cabal of rightwing schemers. he claimed the colombian president, juan manuel santos, was “behind the attack”, supported by a network of plotters and financiers based in florida, adding that a group of hired assassins had already been captured.maduro, whose country is in economic and political turmoil, with inflation predicted to reach 1m% this year, has long accused the international community of waging economic war on him. he regularly lambasts the us as “imperialist” and says it is out to destroy socialism while taking over venezuela’s oil – of which it has the largest reserves in the world.the opposition within venezuela is also a regular target. maduro claims it wants to undo the social reforms brought about by previous president hugo chávez, the charismatic revolutionary who died in 2013. maduro has jailed and sidelined many opposition activists, regularly accusing them of plotting to overthrow him.it is this conspiracy that maduro claims will be unearthed in an ongoing investigation.rightwing rebelsno one has claimed responsibility for the alleged assassination attempt outright, though one group – soldiers franelas – suggested involvement in a tweet. “we have shown [the government] is vulnerable,” the group said. “[the attack] wasn’t achieved today but it is just a matter of time [until it is].” little is known

incident.a hoaxsome observers are suspicious of maduro’s account of events, saying it seems a little too neat in a country where the government has long twisted the truth to its own ends.“the official

office on latin america, voiced doubts that the incident was a staged attack. in an interview with ap, he claimed footage of the chaotic scenes at the parade – which for a short while were broadcast

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0006", "doctext": "thai police arrest bombing suspectbangkok — police in thailand arrested a suspect saturday in connection with the bombing earlier this month that killed 20 people.the man, described as a foreigner, was being charged with possessing explosives and was in military custody, authorities told reporters.the suspect was also found with ball bearings, fuses, pipes and other bomb-making materials, as well as a stack of turkish passports, police and army officials said.all thai television channels carried a brief broadcast by the thai military junta at 6 p.m. saturday announcing the arrest.national police chief general somyot poompanmoung speaks to reporters outside the compound where police detained a suspect in the august 17 bangkok shrine bombing, in a bangkok suburb on aug. 29, 2015.it was the first big breakthrough since the august 17 blast at the popular erawan hindu shrine in central bangkok killed 20 people — thais, chinese, malaysians, a singaporean and an indonesian — and wounding more than 100 people of numerous nationalities.the bombing was the worst single mass casualty attack in thailand.it was followed a day later by an explosion in the chao praya river adjacent to the sathorn pier, about five kilometers away from the shrine. no one was injured in that detonation.authorities believe a separate man on the king taksin bridge, around the time of the shrine blast, had dropped a time bomb into the river.the military junta’s announcement came hours after a “foreign man,” said to be 28 years of age, was taken into custody on the eastern fringe of bangkok.a police source said the arrest of the suspect, who is believed to be turkish, came after investigators sifting through records of mobile phone calls identified three turkish numbers, which had been activated by international roaming services near the blast site, according to the sunday edition of the bangkok post. earlier, authorities had told reporters that a tip from a landlord had led them to the suspect whose apartment building was surrounded by more than 100 police and soldiers on saturday. thai police stand on the balcony outside of an apartment building in nong jok on the outskirts of bangkok, aug. 29, 2015. thai police say they arrested a suspect in the blast at the erawan shrine in this apartment building.the bomb-making materials found at the apartment were similar to those used at the erawan hindu shrine and were linked to the second explosion as well.the suspect's identity remained unclear, but \"we found he's connected to both bangkok blasts,\" said national police spokesman prawut thavornsiri. \"we believe the perpetrators are from the same group.”the thai national police chief told reporters saturday evening that the attacks were “not an international terrorist act.”a handout photo from the royal thai police and released on august 29, 2015 shows the suspect which is being detained at a police station in bangkok.the motive by the main culprit was instead \"taking personal revenge for his comrades,” asserted police general somyot pumpanmuang, without elaborating on how authorities had quickly reached that conclusion.the suspect was being questioned late saturday in the presence of officials of the turkish embassy, local media reported.police released a copy of the photo page of one of the turkish passports with the arrested man’s photo. it was quickly alleged on social media that the passport was a crude forgery with two dates of expiry and several misspellings in turkish.a search was underway for more than 10 additional suspects, some of whom were already believed to have left the kingdom, police said, but they had been ruled out as being part of a wider international terrorist network.the thai police have come under criticism for their investigation, in which they had released contradictory information about possible suspects in the bombing.the prime suspect was captured on closed circuit television — a man in a yellow t-shirt who left a bag at the shrine just before the explosion.this aug. 17, 2015, image, released by royal thai police spokesman lt. gen. prawut thavornsiri shows a man wearing a yellow t-shirt near the erawan shrine before an explosion occurred in bangkok.authorities denied to voa that chinese were likely the primary target.in recent days speculation had increased about a possible link to china's ethnic uighur minority or their co-religious sympathizers in turkey.thailand’s military government last month forcibly repatriated more than 100 turkey-bound uighur refugees to china, a move condemned by international human rights groups.that led to an attack on the thai consulate in istanbul where windows were smashed.voa's ron

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0012", "doctext": "boston bombing suspect found guiltyboston — dzhokhar tsarnaev was convicted on all counts wednesday in the 2013 boston marathon bombings by a federal jury that now must decide whether the 21-year-old former college student should be executed.jurors spent slightly more than 11 hours deciding tsarnaev's guilt in two days of deliberations after 16 days of testimony.\"it's not something that will ever be over,\" said karen brassard, whose ankles and shin were injured by pieces of the bomb. \"you'll feel it forever. it's forever a part of our life. ... i don't know what justice is. i'm grateful to have him off the street.''two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the marathon finish line on april 15, 2013, killing three people – martin richard, 8, chinese student lingzi lu, 23, and krystle campbell, 29 – and wounding more than 260 others.tsarnaev also was convicted in the death of sean collier, a massachusetts institute of technology patrol officer shot to death three days later, as tsarnaev and his older brother, tamerlan, attempted to evade police.the defendant, dressed in a blue sweater and dark blazer, looked pale as he entered the courtroom to hear the verdict. his lawyer, judy clarke, gave him a brief pat on the back as he sat down.voa's fatima tlisova reported tsarnaev folded his arms, fidgeted and looked down at the defense table as he listened to one guilty verdict after another on all 30 counts against him, including conspiracy, murder and use of a weapon of mass destruction.there were some families of victims in the courtroom, and their reaction as the verdict was read was very calm, tlisova observed. she noted, though, they seemed satisfied with the verdict, judging by discussions she had with them outside the courthouse.seventeen of the counts are capital offenses, making tsarnaev eligible for the death penalty.“i hope today’s verdict provides a small amount of closure for the survivors, families, and all impacted by the violent and tragic events surrounding the 2013 boston marathon,” boston mayor martin walsh said in a statement. “the incidents of those days have forever left a mark on our city.”judy clarke, left, and david bruck, defense attorneys for convicted boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev, will try to prevent his getting a death sentence. they're shown at the federal courthouse in boston, massachusetts, april 6, 2015.penalty phaseduring the penalty phase, which could begin as early as monday, tsarnaev's lawyers will present so-called mitigating evidence they hope will save his life.that could include evidence about his family, his relationship with his brother, and his childhood in the former soviet republic of kyrgyzstan and later in the volatile dagestan region of russia.tsarnaev's conviction was practically a foregone conclusion: his lawyers admitted he participated in the bombings.but in a bid to save tsarnaev from a death sentence, defense attorney clarke argued that tsarnaev, then 19, fell under the influence of his radicalized older brother. tamerlan tsarnaev, 26, died when he was shot by police and run over by his brother during a chaotic getaway attempt days after the bombing.\"if not for tamerlan, it [the bombing] would not have happened,\" clarke told the jury during closing arguments.prosecutors laid out evidence that the defendant, an ethnic chechen who emigrated from russia a decade before the attack, had read and listened to jihadist materials, and wrote a note in the boat where he was found hiding suggesting the bombing was an act of retribution for u.s. military campaigns in muslim-dominated countries.jurors' questionsearlier wednesday, the jury asked u.s. district judge george o'toole to clarify two legal terms.south boston resident joe kebartas, holding a sign reading \"death penalty is murder,\" demonstrates outside the federal courthouse where boston marathon bombing suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev has been convicted on all 30 counts, april 8, 2015.they asked about the term \"conspiracy,\" which appears in several of the charges. o'toole explained it applied to a plot between dzhokhar and tamerlan tsarnaev that existed from february through april 19 of 2013, when the younger brother was caught.jurors also asked if \"aiding and abetting,\" which also appears in several charges, were separate ideas. the judge said the terms represent a single concept.massachusetts has not executed anyone since 1947, and roman catholic bishops in the state reiterated their opposition to the death penalty on

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0015", "doctext": "diy drone instructable: how to deliver a payloadoverviewthese instructions guide you to build a diy payload delivery drone system that can be mounted on your drone/quadcopter and used to deliver a package to any address.the smart, low-cost delivery solution uses gps to find its destination and then employs an ultrasonic sensor to measure the ground clearance.depending on your drone capabilities, this payload system can lift up to 2kg freight.a servo motor is used to release the payload at the desired location.this guide also provides a solution to the sensor integration problem.you can integrate gps, servo, and ultrasonic sensors without any serial interference.diy payload delivery drone systemcomponentsbreadboardarduino mega/unoservo motor

wiresbottle caphair pinstep 1: connecting the ultrasonic sensortake the breadboard and affix the arduino to its one side, as shown in the picture.now, take the hc-sr04 ultrasonic sensor and attach it to the lower side of the breadboard.make the connections as shown in figure 1.connect the pins as follows:vcc (ultrasonic) -> 5v (arduino)gnd (ultrasonic) -> gnd (arduino)trig pin (ultrasonic) -> pin 8 (arduino)echo pin (ultrasonic) -> pin 9 (arduino)run the following code to check if the ultrasonic sensor is functional.the serial monitor will show the following output:step 2: connecting the gps moduletake the neo-6m gps module and insert its pins into the breadboard.make connections as shown in figure 2.don’t forget to download tinygps++ library if missing.connect the pins as follows:vcc (gps module) -> 3.3v (arduino)2gnd (gps module) -> gnd (arduino)rx pin (gps module) -> pin 1 (arduino)tx pin (gps module) -> pin 0 (arduino)figure 2run the following code and check if the gps sensor is functional.don’t forget to remove the tx pin of gps module from pin 0 of arduino; otherwise, your code won’t upload.once the code is uploaded, first open serial monitor; then, connect the tx pin of gps to pin 0 to view the current location of drone, time, and date.the serial monitor will show output:step 3: connecting the bottle capnow, take a bottle cap to prepare the payload-releasing mechanism.the mechanism itself is simple.you hook the payload on the hairpin inside the bottle cap, and when the servo moves it pulls off the hairpin from the bottle cap, resulting the payload to drop.make holes on both sides of the cap.attach the cap on the lower side of the breadboard, as shown in the pictures.step 4: connecting the servofirst, take a hair pin and connect it to the limb of the servo using a staple, as shown in the picture.take the servo and attach it under the breadboard such that the hair pin passes through both the holes of the bottle cap.connect the servo with arduino in the following way, as shown in figure 3.pwm pin (servo) -> pin 14 (arduino)vcc pin (servo) -> 5v (arduino)gnd pin (servo) -> gnd (arduino)figure 3it will look like this when you attach the whole system to your drone.run the following code to check if the servo is functional.step 5: putting it all togethermake sure you make all the connections as shown in figure 4.you’ll integrate the sensors without using softwareserial library.employing hardware serial ports of your arduino will minimize serial interference between libraries; hence, eliminating the servo vibration.figure 4open the arduino window and paste the following code.in the code, set the desired gps coordinates (latitude, longitude) where you need to drop off the basket.once the desired location is added, click upload.again, don’t forget to remove the tx pin of gps from pin 0 before uploading the code.upload the code on your arduino and click the serial monitor icon in the top right corner.you’ll see the current gps coordinates of your drone.let your drone fly to the desired location.when your drone reaches the desired address, bring it closer to the ground.the ultrasonic sensor will calculate the ground clearance.when it’s about 15 cm, the servo releases the payload.the serial monitor prompts you when the package is delivered, and records the time as well.after dropping the payload, fly your drone back to its initial point.precaution do not put more than 2 kg load in the basket otherwise it will damage the assembly.also be sure to check the spec of your drone so you will know how much weight that drone can handle.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "transport", "Transporter": [], "PassengerArtifact": [[["payload", 41]]], "Vehicle": [], "Origin": [], "Destination": []},

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0016", "doctext": "boston bomber admits guilt, receives death sentenceconvicted boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev apologized at his sentencing hearing wednesday before he was formally sentenced to death for the deadly 2013 attack. the 21-year chechen immigrant stood in a federal courtroom in boston and admitted that he and his late older brother, tamerlan, planted two pressure-cooker bombs that exploded near the finish line of the legendary race on april 15, 2013, killing three people and leaving 264 others injured, including 17 who suffered severed limbs. \"i am sorry for the lives that i've taken, for the suffering that i caused you, for the damage i've done, irreparable damage\" tsarnaev said in his first public remarks since his arrest. but judge george o'toole offered no sympathy for tsarnaev as he handed down the death sentence, saying no one will remember the kind of person he was before the bombing. \"what will be remembered is that you murdered and maimed innocent people, and that you did it willfully and intentionally,\" said o'toole.before making his statement, tsarnaev sat impassively and listened to three hours of testimony from 24 victims and survivors who told how the bombing had adversely affected their lives. the mother of krystal campbell, one of the three people killed in the bombing, lashed out at tsarnaev, saying \"the choices that you made are despicable and what you did to my daughter is disgusting.\"many of the survivors questioned and even rejected tsarnaev's expression of remorse, calling it insincere. but one survivor, henry borgard, told reporters after the hearing that he accepted tsarnaev's apology. \"i was actually really happy that he made the statement,\" said borgard, who was injured as he was walking home from work that day. \"as i said in my personal impact statement, i have forgiven him. i have come to a place of peace and i genuinely hope that he does as well. for me to hear him say that he's sorry, that is enough for me.\" and the father of 8-year-old martin richard, who was also killed in the attack along with campbell and chinese exchange student lingzi lu, said he and his family have moved on. \"he chose hate. he chose destruction. he chose death,” said bill richard. “this is all on him. we choose love. we choose kindness. we choose peace.”the jury voted unanimously last month to condemn dzhokhar tsarnaev to death, just days after convicting him on all 30 charges brought against him -- 17 of which carried the possibility of the death penalty. in addition to the three bombing victims, tsarnaev was also convicted in the death of sean collier, a police officer with the massachusetts institute of technology police department killed during a shootout with the tsarnaev brothers three days after the attack.his attorneys argued during the penalty phase of the trial that dzhokhar was under the strong influence of his radicalized older brother, who was killed in the same shootout that killed mit police officer collier.dzhokhar tsarnaev will likely be sent to a federal prison in indiana to await execution -- a process that could take years as his lawyers appeal his case through the federal court system.

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0019", "doctext": "on 17 january 2019, a vehicle was driven into the general santander national police academy in bogotá, colombia. the truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. suicide attacks are unusual in colombia. the car contained about  of pentolite. it was the deadliest attack on the colombian capital since the 2003 el nogal club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 centro andino bombing. the national liberation army (eln) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.==background===== colombian conflict ===the colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (thousand days' war). the national liberation army (eln) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. for decades, residents of bogotá lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or pablo escobar's medellín drug cartel. but as colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.sporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. the most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket andino shopping mall in june 2017 which killed three people, including a french woman, and injured another 11. police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the people revolutionary's movement for the bombing.=== peace dialogue ===the 2016 peace deal between the farc and colombian government resulted in the eln gaining strength in the region. the colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the eln since 2017, though eln groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. the eln, however, persisted that the colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. between 2017 and up until the attack, colombian officials stated that the eln had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants.=== eln in venezuela ===according to insight crime, the eln and farc dissidents allegedly met together in venezuela to form a potential alliance in october 2018. sources based in the arauca department in colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. it was also alleged that former farc commander iván márquez participated in the talks with the eln.in november 2018, insight crime also reported that the eln was present in over twelve venezuelan states, spanning from the colombia-venezuela border in the west across venezuela and into brazil and guyana to the east. insight crime states that venezuelan president nicolás maduro was tolerant of the eln, explaining that \"eln’s expansion in venezuela has been marked by the maduro administration’s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\", with reports from venezuelan ngo fundación redes that the venezuelan military had possibly armed eln members.==events===== planning ===attorney general  identified the perpetrator as josé aldemar rojas rodríguez, known as \"mocho kiko\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of boyacá. rojas is alleged to have been involved with the eln for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. since 2011, rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in venezuela how to construct explosives.ricardo carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted rojas for the bombing due to his experience. the bombing, according to colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. in may 2018, colombian records show that rojas purchased a 1993 nissan patrol from mauricio mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. on 27 july 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in arauca, arauca, a city found on the border of colombia and venezuela where the eln mainly controls territory.=== attack ===the authorities stated that on 17 january 2019 at 9:30am, rojas drove his grey 1993 nissan patrol loaded with  of pentolite to the campus of the general santander national police academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. when a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. the explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. it is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device.in the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating rojas's possible connections to either the national liberation army (eln) guerrilla movement, the clan úsuga organized crime gang, or farc dissidents.=== initial investigations ===on 18 january, defence minister  identified rojas rodríguez as a long-time member of the eln, within which he served as an explosives expert. investigators were able to identify rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand.a second individual, who attorney general martínez said \"had participated in the attack\", was arrested in bogotá at 2:30am on the day following the attack.  the individual was identified as ricardo carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. he was found with a \"combatant's manual\" and numerous coveralls. carvajal salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked.according to colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout bogotá and the department of arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the eln was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past.=== peace dialogue ends ===president iván duque márquez announced on 18 january that peace dialogue between the government of colombia and the eln was officially suspended. duque also demanded that cuba extradite the ten eln leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their interpol red notices, and he criticized venezuela for providing refuge for the eln on the colombia-venezuela border. in response to the request, cuba's foreign minister announced that cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.the president of the national constituent assembly of venezuela, diosdado cabello, denied any venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 january. on 21 january, colombian foreign minister carlos holmes trujillo called for a \"concrete response\" from the government of nicolás maduro in venezuela on whether the eln was present in venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the colombian government asked the venezuelan government on the potential presence of eln groups in venezuela without a response. holmes trujillo also stated that the maduro government had taken \"evasive positions\" when speaking about the eln.===claim of responsibility===eln accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. it justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. high peace commissioner miguel ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility.==international reactions==a foreign national, identified as a female cadet from ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from panama, one from the united states and another also from ecuador were wounded. their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens.* cuba: cuba shared condolences with colombia, with its foreign ministry stating cuba \"will act with strict respect for the protocols of dialogue and peace signed by the government and the eln, including the protocol in case of a rupture in negotiations\".* ecuador: president lenín moreno lamented the death of erika chicó, the ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to colombia. he also announced that he was to send vice president otto sonnenholzner to bogotá accompanied by chicó's relatives.* panama: the panamanian embassy in bogotá expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about panamanian cadets affected.* united states: the assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs kimberly breier condemned the bombing and said: \"our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\", while the u.s. embassy in bogotá offered its \"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\".argentina, brazil, peru, venezuela, and the organization of american states also condemned the attack.==references==",

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0028", "doctext": "oklahoma city bombing documentary examines growth of american extremismwashington — the oklahoma city bombing nearly 22 years ago was an act of domestic terror by u.s. military veteran timothy mcveigh and his accomplice, terry nichols. the bombing destroyed one third of the alfred p. murrah federal building in downtown oklahoma city, oklahoma, killing 168 people and injuring 680 others. in his documentary, oklahoma city, filmmaker barak goodman revisits the bombing as the first major domestic terrorist attack in the united states on april 19, 1995.it was the number of civilians killed - especially the 15 children, four of them infants, crushed inside the building's day care center - that made this terrorist attack by a massive fertilizer bomb so heinous for many americans. many films have recounted the story, but goodman’s documentary treats the oklahoma city bombing as a springboard to examine the roots of america's ultra-right militia and to analyze the makeup of homegrown american terrorism.history of suspicion“it goes all the way back to the founding of the republic,” the filmmaker told voa. \"the republic was founded on the suspicion of government.\" goodman says many of these extreme separatists believe in white supremacy and in unregulated freedom to keep and bear arms so that they can protect themselves from outsiders and the government.in the documentary, former militia member kerry noble explains the ideology. “the government is an enemy of the people, and in this war it’s an all or nothing. we’re either gonna win as the white race or we’re gonna lose.” file - in this april 21, 1995 file photo, timothy mcveigh is led out of the noble county courthouse by state and federal law enforcement officials in perry, oklahoma, after being identified as a suspect in the bombing of the oklahoma city federal building. mcveigh was eventually convicted of the bombing and executed.oklahoma city points to two events in the late 20th century that bolstered separatist ideologies: the ruby ridge incident on august 21, 1992, and the waco siege in waco, texas, between february 28 and april 19, 1993. in both cases, federal and local government agents clashed with american separatists. the deadly incidents were fueled by the authorities' demand to search the premises for illegal firearms.the waco siege was particularly deadly. the compound belonged to a group known as the branch davidians, led by david koresh. when federal authorities sent in armed agents and armored vehicles to end the standoff, a fire engulfed the compound, killing 82 people, including david koresh. sixty-two of the victims were women and children.birth of an extremisttimothy mcveigh, a gulf war veteran disillusioned by the government during his tour in iraq, was among those who went to witness the siege. according to the documentary, mcveigh was radicalized by those events and by an extremist publication called the turner diaries.“it’s a talisman for the far right, even to this day, but especially back in the '90s and '80s it was the ‘bible’ of this movement,” says goodman. “it’s a novel about a small group of ‘patriots,’ ‘white patriots’ who retake the government from the jews and blacks who have infiltrated it, essentially. it’s a racist creed and as i said, it is very poorly done. intriguingly though, it describes the bombing of the fbi, the culmination of the novel, and it really lays out a recipe on how to build a bomb like this.\"that bomb is very similar to the one mcveigh used in oklahoma city.\"mcveigh was deeply, deeply influenced by this book,\" goodman adds. \"he sold it in gun shows, he quoted it, when he was arrested he had several pages of it in a folder beside him in a car. and it wasn’t just mcveigh, it was all through this movement. people were really exorcised, impassioned, inflamed by this novel.\"file - in this may 5, 1995, photo, search and rescue personnel attend a memorial service in front of the alfred p. murrah federal building in oklahoma, destroyed by a fertilizer bomb in what is considered the first major domestic terrorist attack in the u.s.the documentary shows mcveigh obsessed with his guns and with the idea that the government was going to take them away. the film also points out that his exposure to the war in iraq accelerated his feeling of mistrust of the u.s. government. “the way he put it made it sound he was emphatic towards the dead iraqi soldiers that he killed. i really don’t think that’s the case,” says barak goodman. instead, says the filmmaker, it was mcveigh’s mistrust of the u.s. government, how it had blundered into iraq and his idea of the u.s. government as a bully, and mcveigh, says goodman, hated bullies. the ruby ridge and waco stand-offs reinforced that idea in his mind.homegrown extremismaccording to the documentary, there are 500 militia organizations in the u.s. today. goodman believes they are as radicalized as ever. “some of them have gotten rid of their camouflage outfits and put on suits and ties, but really the rhetoric has been virtually the same for 100 years or more. ‘it’s a whites-only country, it should be a whites-only country, the federal government is in the hands of jews, blacks, it’s a conspiracy.'”goodman says it is a misconception to believe that this is a movement of white poor disenfranchised people. certainly, he says, many are, but there also many professionals feeling a loss of entitlement, a loss of privilege and power. the filmmaker stresses that these people operate outside political parties and share a deep mistrust of the washington political establishment.but goodman cautions these extremists are not de facto terrorists. he says it takes a confluence of opportunity and a warped personality, often a lone individual, to commit a terrorist act of a scale such as the oklahoma city bombing.“mcveigh was a shock to most people in the fbi. it would be less of a shock today. but it’s very hard to prevent these things. one of the takeaways from our film and audiences who have seen it have been amazed at how really easy it was to do this. it cost about $6000, it was one guy, reading some literature,” says the filmmaker.file -

\"closure\".he said: \"my apologies and my heartfelt sympathies to all of you, for the terrible, tragic loss that you've been put through. and all these years you've been trying to find closure. i hope at last god will be merciful and bring you closure.\"and i apologise not only for myself ... i apologise for all active republicans who had no intention of hurting anybody and sympathise with you.\"an eight-minute delay before police were warned of the bombs' location led to the death of 21 people and the injury of 182 others, when they exploded in a pair of city centre pubs. mr hayes said the bombs had not been intended to kill people.on the evening of the 21 november 1974, a man with an irish accent called the birmingham post and evening mail newspapers to say two bombs were planted in the town centre.he finished the call by giving the official code used by the provisional ira to authenticate a warning call and allow civilians to be evacuated.former ira officials have since said there was an unintentional delay in issuing the warning.mr hayes said the ira unit in birmingham had been shocked by the death toll.\"that wasn't meant. it wouldn't have been done if that was the case,\" he said.the wreckage left at the mulberry bush pub in birmingham after a bomb exploded on 21 november 1974 (pa)the birmingham pub bombings caused the worst single losses of life in the

birmingham's hagley road after he became aware of the death toll in the first two blasts.he refused to say who planted the bombs in the mulberry bush and the tavern in the town but he said he wanted to speak out to give \"the point of view of a participant\".but relatives of those who were killed said the apology was \"gutless and spineless\".mr hayes' apology came as an inquest into the bombings was reopened by a coroner stating \"a wealth of evidence\" had not yet been heard.west midland police said their investigation remained open but that no further comments on the suspects' identities will be provided until the proceedings have concluded.victims' families have repeatedly asked for the names of the suspects to be disclosed.mr hayes was arrested and questioned by west midlands police about the bombings in 1974 but he was released.he said he had been a member of the ira for more than 30 years in both ireland and england and had participated in the group's activities in birmingham

proposals from each of the candidates, presented three times a day on national radio and tv cadenas, are more a joke than a real constitutional project.chavismo’s done what it can to give sunday’s election the look-and-feel of a major political event, but they’ve come up short in both substance and style. superficially, this election is just another rumba chavista. with the catchy song, a dog dancing, and the infamous candidate la máscara.“we’re going to knock on the door of anyone who gets confused… our message is to vote, to consolidate what we have accomplished.”the farce element runs deep here. in reality there’s no sense of anticipation at all, all candidates represent the same party. out of the 537 constituents, perhaps 7 to 10 of them will make decisions: the other fivehundred-some-odd are purely filler, there to raise their hand on command. which ones get elected matters exclusively to the individuals involved.still, you need to get people to vote.but the real reason to vote has nothing to do with any cute song. it’s fear.venezuela has more than two million public sector workers, and each one is well aware that la masa no está pa’ bollos.the time for subtle coaxing and coded messages is long gone. chavismo’s get-out-the-vote strategy consists of threatening them mercilessly.maduro already said that voters must present their id and carnet de la patria at the door of every voting center, “to see who votes.”“if we have 15,000 workers (in a public institution), all 15,000 must vote, no excuse”, psuv leader diosdado cabello said as he explained the way the carnet de la patria allows the government to keep track of who’s voted and who hasn’t, in real time.“we’re going to knock on the door of anyone who gets confused,” diosdado went on. “our message is to vote, to consolidate what we have accomplished.”as for vice-president tarek el aissami, he is leveraging the clap grocery distribution: “we didn’t let you die. now it’s your turn to not let the revolution die”.and that’s a bouquet of subtlety compared to anc candidate and brother of late president chávez, adán chávez, who said “if we have to take up arms to defend the legacy of chávez and maduro, we will”.the interior minister, néstor reverol, decided that the threats will not be exclusive for chavista voters, assuring that now any meeting or protest that “can affect” the election is prohibited, adding that this “crime” will be be punished with 5 to 10 years in prison.the economic crisis is part of the campaign. maduro has assured us that, with the constituyente, all economic problems will be fixed, even raising the minimum wage weeks before the election.some of the threats are startlingly direct…money talks, even in voting centers, but governor vielma mora took a step forward proposing that any “company or person” who doesn’t vote, shouldn’t participate in the dicom foreign exchange system. as he sees it, that would be giving dollars “to right wing terrorists.”it’s legitimately scary when you realize he’s not alone in this line of thought.these threats have crossed the country and even reached colombian borders. roberth guerra, a leader of un nuevo tiempo in táchira, denounced that “public workers of the border, dependent of the regional and national government, have told us how the authorities intimidate them – they must sign a letter of resignation if they fail to vote, they have been threatened to lose their clap bags, and told that pensions for the elderly will be revoked.”on july 16th, the opposition drew its line in the sand: 7.6 million. the goal for the government is to overcome that mark. with money tight, that won’t be easy. intimidation is the only card they have left.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "threaten", "Communicator": [], "Recipient": [[["them", 1069]]], "Topic": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "threaten", "Communicator": [], "Recipient": [[["voters", 1650]]], "Topic": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "broadcast", "Communicator": [[["maduro", 1625]]], "Recipient": [[["us", 122]]], "Instrument": [], "Topic": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "threaten", "Communicator": [[["they", 232]]], "Recipient": [], "Topic": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "broadcast", "Communicator": [[["candidates", 349]]], "Recipient": [], "Instrument": [[["radio", 401]], [["tv cadenas", 411]]], "Topic": [[["proposals", 322]]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "command", "Communicator": [[["maduro", 1625]]], "Recipient": [[["voters", 1650]]], "Topic": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "contact", "Participant": [[["diosdado cabello", 1858]]], "Topic": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "contact", "Participant": [[["adán chávez", 2416]]], "Topic": [], "Place": []}]}

dancer heather abbott, who lost both legs in the blast, and former boston police commissioner ed davis were among the people who packed the courtroom for closing arguments.the defendant sat quietly in court on monday, dressed in a white shirt, dark jacket and no tie. he did not speak.the surveillance video viewed by the jury on monday shows a bomb, which the defendant is charged with leaving in front of the forum restaurant near the finish line, going off with a blinding flash, killing richard and lu. the jury also saw video taken by a man injured in the blast.the graphic video captures the chaos of the immediate aftermath, with one responder yelling that he was worried about the possibility of an additional blast and another voice screaming, \"we're on fire here. we're on fire.\"", "templates": [{"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [[["dzhokhar tsarnaev", 102]], [["brother", 139]]], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": [[["boston", 8]]]}, {"incident_type": "die", "Victim": [[["people", 205]]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "die", "Victim": [[["krystle campbell", 1827]], [["lingzi lu", 1874]], [["martin richard", 1904]]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "transport", "Transporter": [], "PassengerArtifact": [[["tsarnaev", 111]]], "Vehicle": [], "Origin": [[["russia", 2534]]], "Destination": [[["united states", 2515]]]}, {"incident_type": "die", "Victim": [[["tamerlan", 495]]], "Place": [], "Killer": [[["police", 428]]], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "manufacture", "ManufacturerAssembler": [[["tamerlan", 495]]], "Artifact": [[["bombs", 1012]]], "Components": [], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}]}

fragments that may have included nails, bbs and ball bearings, the agency said.-- the second bomb was in a metal container, but it was unclear whether it was in a pressure cooker as well, the fbi said.-- photos obtained by cnn show the remains of a pressure cooker found at the scene, along with a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings.-- they were sent to the fbi's national laboratory in virginia, where technicians will try to reconstruct the devices.-- in the past, the u.s. government has warned federal agencies that terrorists could turn pressure cookers into bombs by packing them with explosives and shrapnel, and detonating them with blasting caps.-- authorities sifted through thousands of pieces of evidence and a mass of digital photos and video clips.they have pleaded for the public's help in providing additional leads and images.the casualtiesthe blasts left three people dead.-- martin richard , an 8-year-old boy with a gap-tooth grin and bright eyes.he loved to run and play in his yard.-- krystle campbell , a 29-year-old freckle-faced woman described as having \"a heart of gold.\"-- the third victim was lingzu lu , a graduate student at boston university, who had moved to the city last fall, making friends and soaking up new experiences.-- of the approximately 178 people injured, 66 remain in area hospitals, according to the latest cnn tally.thirteen of those are still in critical condition, hospital officials said.- martin's mother and sister are among the wounded.his mother underwent surgery for a brain injury, and his 6-year-old sister lost her leg.the injuries-- doctors say dozens of victims suffered injuries to their legs that involve blood vessels, bone and tissue.-- the bombings resulted in at least 13 amputations and left doctors picking ball bearings out of victims in the emergency room, a terrorism expert briefed on the investigation said.-- dr. george velmahos, head of trauma care at massachusetts general hospital, said his team found \"numerous\" metal pellets and nails inside patients' bodies.\"there are people who have 10, 20, 30, 40 of them in their body, or more,\" velmahos said.-- dr. ron walls also said one patient had more than 12 carpenter-type nails.\"there is no question some of these objects were implanted in the device for the purpose of being exploded forward,\" he said.terror group links-- while the clues moved the investigation forward, it is still unclear whether the attack was an act of domestic or foreign terrorism.-- no connection has been made to any terrorist group or individual.-- president barack obama described the bombings as an act of terrorism, but said it is unclear whether they were the work of a group or \"a malevolent individual.\"-- the pakistani taliban has said it was not involved in the attack.-- authorities don't have a sense of what the motive is, an official said.-- the fbi asked the public to report anyone who talked about targeting the marathon or showed interest in explosives.the agency urged anyone who might have heard explosions in remote areas -- possibly by someone testing a bomb -- or seen someone carrying \"an unusually heavy, dark-colored bag\" around the time of the attack to come forward.'possible' suspectsthree days later, authorities have yet to make an arrest, but have made \"significant progress,\" a law enforcement official said.-- investigators have pinpointed two men of \"high interest\" as possible suspects after they appeared in images near the finish line moments before the blasts, a law enforcement official said.-- one of the men is seen carrying a black backpack.-- authorities had not yet named the two, but their photographs have been distributed to law enforcement, a source said.-- earlier wednesday, two sources with knowledge of the investigation identified a man as a possible suspect in the attack, but did not name him.-- seen on a video, the man wore a white baseball cap.one of the sources added that the cap was on backwards and the man was also wearing a light-colored hooded sweatshirt and a black jacket.-- it was not immediately clear if he is one of those alluded to in the photographs distributed to law enforcement officials.-- investigators are closer to cracking the case \"every hour,\" massachusetts gov.deval patrick said.he urged patience with the probe to allow investigators space to do their job.-- \"i wish they had nailed the perpetrator within minutes of this catastrophe, but i understand from experience it's going to take some time,\" he said.the investigation-- significant progress has been made in the investigation, but there has been no arrest, the fbi told cnn.-- after sources told cnn on wednesday that an arrest had been made, sources with the department of justice and boston police department each said that no arrest had been made.-- a source with boston law enforcement said, \"we got him,\" but would not clarify whether that meant an identification had been made or an arrest carried out.-- some federal sources said that it would be going too far to say even that an identification had been made, but several sources in boston disputed that, saying a clear identification had been made.-- investigators believe they have identified a suspect in the marathon bombings, a source who has been briefed on the investigation told cnn's john king.the possible breakthrough came from an analysis of video from a lord and taylor department store near the site of the second blast, and video from a boston tv station helped as well, the official said.-- as they scramble to search for suspects, authorities are processing \"the most complex crime scene that we have dealt with in the history of our department,\" said ed davis, the boston police commissioner.-- forensic specialists and dogs trained to detect explosive devices and their residue were at the scene of the blasts.a command post has been created, with 1,000 officers conducting interviews and gathering details.-- authorities have received 2,000 tips from around the world, said richard deslauriers, the special agent in charge of the fbi's boston office.\"someone knows who did this,\" he said.security elsewhere-- cities have stepped up security after the attacks, including washington, new york, miami, chicago, atlanta and los angeles.--

mark the boston tragedy.reaction-- \"boston is not going to be intimidated by this,\" said secretary of state john kerry, a former u.s. senator from massachusetts.\"but we are going to find out who did this.the police work being done is extraordinary.the fbi is remarkable.there is a great deal of forensic evidence.we are hopeful we can bring people to justice.\"\"the islamic republic condemns

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0039", "doctext": "the king's cross station and euston station bombings were two bombing attacks on 10 september 1973 by the provisional irish republican army (ira) that targeted two mainline railway stations in central london. the blasts wounded 13 civilians, some of whom were seriously injured, and also caused large-scale but superficial damage. this was a second wave of bombing attacks launched by the ira in england in 1973 after the old bailey car bombing earlier in the year which had killed one  and injured around 200 civilians.==background==in 1971, during the troubles, after two years engaged in violence based on a defensive strategy in irish communal districts of northern ireland, the provisional ira launched an offensive against the united kingdom. at a meeting of the ira army council in june 1972 the organization's chief of staff, seán mac stíofáin, first proposed making bombing attacks in england. the army council did not at first agree to the suggestion, but in early 1973 after its negotiations with the british government for a truce the previous year had failed to advance the political objective of the removal of northern ireland from the united kingdom by the application of the threat of violence, it re-engaged its paramilitary campaign and sanctioned mac stíofáin's proposal. mac stíofáin had put the strategy forward on the basis that extending the urban paramilitary violence of the northern ireland state into england would help to relieve pressure being exerted by the british army on the ira's strongholds of irish communal support in districts in the province, such as west belfast and derry, by diverting british security strength from them back into england, whilst at the same time increasing strategic pressure upon the british government to resolve the conflict by political concessions to the ira's demands. he also believed that a successful bombing campaign in london, as the capital city of the united kingdom, would offer substantial propaganda value for paramilitary irish republicanism, and provide a morale boost to its supporters.the effects of the previous 1973 old bailey bombing appeared to give some credence to the idea of the propaganda value of extending violence into london as, although it would have been considered almost routine in northern ireland by the mid-1970s and have drawn only brief media notice, being carried out instead in london, a global capital city, had made the event world news headlines. however, although the bombing of the old bailey had been successfully carried out, and had gained media attention, increasing political pressure upon the british government to address the issue of the conflict in northern ireland with more urgency, it had been costly to the ira, as 10 out of the 11 man active service unit that had carried it out had been arrested by the british police whilst trying to leave england before the bombs they had planted detonated. drawing the tactical lesson that large teams were a security liability, for the second wave of bombings in england later in 1973, instead of sending a large team to carry it out with orders to withdraw back to ireland immediately afterwards, smaller detached \"cell\" units of about 3-4 personnel were sent to carry out the operation, with instructions to remain in england afterwards and wage a campaign of bombings around england upon a variety of targets.there were bombings on 8 september 1973, including one at victoria railway station which injured four civilians.==bombings==on 10 september 1973 a bomb (with no warning issued beforehand) exploded at king's cross railway station in the booking hall at 12.24 p.m. when a youth of around 16/17 years of age walked up to the entrance of the station's old booking hall and threw a bag into it which contained a 3 lb (1.4 kg) device, which detonated, shattering glass throughout the hall and throwing a baggage trolley several feet into the air. the youth then fled into the station's crowd and escaped the scene.approximately 45 minutes after the attack at king's cross, after a telephone called warning 5 minutes beforehand by a man with an irish accent to the press association, a second bomb detonated in a snack bar at euston railway station, injuring another eight civilians. one witness at euston said: \"i saw a flash and suddenly people were being thrown through the air - it was a terrible mess, they were bleeding and screaming\" a total of 13 civilians were injured in the two attacks. the metropolitan police issued a photofit picture of a 5 ft 2 tall 16/17-year-old youth they were seeking in regard to the king's cross attack.==subsequent events==on 12 september 1973 two more bombs exploded, one in oxford street and another in sloane square, targeting retail shopping centres. police subsequently announced that they were looking for five people in connection with this second wave of bomb attacks in england.judith ward was later wrongly convicted for having been involved in the late 1973 london bombings, along with the m62 coach bombing. she was later acquitted. no one else was brought to trial for this ira bombing campaign.==see also==*bombings of paddington and victoria stations *chronology of provisional irish republican army actions (1970–79)==sources==* cain project * bbc on this day  bomb blasts rock central london ==references==", "templates": [{"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["stations", 181]], [["king's cross station", 4]], [["euston station", 29]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["civilians", 231]]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [[["ira", 141]]], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": [[["england", 396]]]}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["old bailey", 422]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "die", "Victim": [[["one", 482]]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["civilians", 231]]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [[["seán mac stíofáin", 834]]], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": [[["england", 396]]]}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": [[["london", 201]]]}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["old bailey", 422]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["old bailey", 422]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [[["england", 396]]], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["victoria railway station", 3433]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["civilians", 231]]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["king's cross railway station", 3575]], [["hall", 3619]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [[["bomb", 44]]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [[["youth", 3645]]], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [[["device", 3796]]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["they", 2891]]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["civilians", 231]]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "attack", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["civilians", 231]]], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "attack", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["king's cross", 4]]], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["centres", 4753]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [[["bombs", 2885]]], "Place": [[["oxford street", 4683]], [["sloane square", 4712]]]}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [[["bomb", 44]]], "Place": [[["england", 396]]]}, {"incident_type": "convict", "JudgeCourt": [], "Defendant": [[["judith ward", 4894]]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": [[["london", 201]]]}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["m62", 5008]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [[["ira", 141]]], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["paddington", 5140]], [["stations", 181]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["london", 201]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [[["bomb", 3489]]], "Place": []}]}

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0043", "doctext": "counting civilian casualties in cia’s drone wara report released in september by human rights researchers at stanford law school and new york university law school sets out to demonstrate that u.s. drone policies are \"damaging and counterproductive.\"media outlets from cnn to bbc hailed the report as new evidence of the u.s. government’s false narrative on drones and the new york times‘ scott shane described the study as \"among the most thorough on the subject to date.\"while the stanford-nyu report certainly presents a comprehensive review of existing drone research, its new contributions to the evidentiary record are far more modest than its sweeping conclusions would suggest.number crunchingthe u.s. government claims that civilian casualties caused by drones are in the \"single digits\" during obama’s years in office, while the stanford-nyu report seeks to establish that there is significant evidence that u.s. drone strikes have killed and injured a larger number of civilians. this is a low bar, and would merely necessitate proving that more than 10 civilians have been killed by drones since obama assumed office, a claim that has been made by all three major databases aggregating information on drone strikes. the stanford-nyu report goes further, claiming that between 474 and 881 civilians have been killed since 2004.however, this does not represent new evidence. stanford and nyu researchers made no attempt to offer new statistical analysis on the number of civilian casualties caused by drones. rather, their report is essentially an extended endorsement of a database compiled by the bureau of investigative journalism, a small team of journalists based out of city university, london. in doing so, the report rejects the findings of two other widely cited databases, the long war journal, which reports 138 civilian deaths and new america foundation’s year of the drone, which lists 152-191 civilian deaths and the deaths of 130-268 \"unknowns.\"if the stanford-nyu team wants to paint a picture of the u.s. as a human rights abuser, then the bureau, whose casualty statistics dwarf the more conservative estimates of the other databases, is best suited to that purpose, but that does not make it the most reliable source.while a comprehensive assessment of the bureau’s data should have been conducted before giving it a resounding endorsement, just a cursory review of its account of 2012’s drone strikes reveals problems:– on may 5, 2012 the bureau reports that a strike in north waziristan killed 8-10 people, of whom between zero and ten are listed as civilians. upon reviewing the accompanying sources one find that early reports said the identity of the dead could not be determined, but subsequent reports from government officials identified them as militants. of the 15 sources cited by the bureau, not one states that the victims were civilians.-on june 2, 2012 the bureau reports that 2-4 people were killed and between zero and two of them were civilians. these civilian deaths were inferred based on a report that a motorbike was accidentally hit, but the bureau fails to take note of a later report from the express tribune identifying the motorbike victims as suspected militants khalil yargul khail and rehmanullah gangi khail.-on july 23, 2012 the bureau references 25 sources for a drone strike, only one of which described the victims as local residents and based on this the bureau reports that up to 14 civilians were killed.the stanford-nyu report critiques the long war journal for not making its data available in a verifiable strike-by-strike format, over-relying on u.s. intelligence sources, and identifying all victims as militants unless they are specifically identified as civilians. these are reasonable criticisms, but when the critique turns to new america foundation research, it becomes logically inconsistent.while stanford-nyu researchers admit that all three databases rely on \"the same universe of publicly available press reports,\" they criticize only the new america foundation for over-relying on the anonymous pakistani government officials cited in such news reports. the stanford-nyu report laments that these officials are cited in 88% of articles referenced in new america’s 2012 data but fails to consider that these same articles are referenced by the bureau. furthermore, the only reason the researchers were able to generate that statistic is because new america compiles a highly transparent summary of media sources relied on for each strike with a list of which sources reported which casualty estimates, something no other database provides.the stanford-nyu report goes on to question the \"deep reporting\" capabilities of new america’s sources (the new york times, reuters, ap, bbc, etc.) while uncritically accepting the veracity of reports from fringe outlets such as the kuwait news agency, the south asian news agency, central asia online, and punjab news, which are sometimes the sole sources for the bureau’s reports of civilian casualties.this is not to suggest that the bureau’s research is without merit, but it should be noted that it represents an interpretation of the facts with a bias toward reporting civilian casualties. the bureau’s database does not even have a category for reporting militant deaths. it seems counter-intuitive that the organization’s researchers can have such absolute faith in their civilian casualty estimates, but not have the confidence to label any of the deceased as militants.and the stanford-nyu team was not impartial. by the report’s own admission, the research project it undertook in pakistan to interview family members of drone strike victims was commissioned by reprieve, a uk based advocacy organization. reprieve, which filed two lawsuits on behalf of alleged drone victims in may of 2012, arranged, paid for and collaborated on many of the victim interviews conducted by the stanford-nyu researchers.no database is perfect, but a strong argument could be made that the new america foundation’s policy of attempting to identify both militants and civilians while maintaining an explicit category for \"unknowns\" to represent the uncertainty surrounding many of the strikes is a more balanced representation of the facts. after all, if the public is to assess the efficacy of drone strikes then we need to consider the strikes that hit their targets as well as the ones that do not.stanford and nyu’s analysis of the three drone databases, in some respects, misses the forest for the trees. a comparison of the annual data collected by the bureau with that compiled by the new america foundation suggests that while their numbers may differ, their underlying findings are substantially similar. both the bureau and new america have observed a general decline in the percentage of civilian fatalities since the high in 2006, with a sharp decrease during the obama administration. according to the bureau’s data, the proportion of civilians killed in drone strikes fell from 35 percent in 2008 under president bush to 9 percent thus far in 2012. similarly, new america reports that the rate of civilian and unknown casualties decreased from 23 percent in 2008 to 2 percent in 2012. this stands to reason when we consider that the bureau tends to err on the side of assuming that unidentified dead or individuals of disputed identity are civilians, while new america prefers to accommodate ambiguity by listing \"unknowns\" and only reports a civilian or militant casualty when it is reported by two independent sources.if one takes the average number of civilian and unknown deaths counted by the new america foundation from 2004-2012 as a percentage of the total number of people killed in drone strikes, the civilian and unknown deaths represent 15 percent of the total. the bureau’s data suggests that civilian deaths account for 22 percent of the total killed. these numbers are in fact, not so very far apart. and while the bureau has criticized new america for reporting that in 2012, civilian deaths are approaching zero, the bureau’s own data suggests that the percentage of civilian casualties in 2012 is at nine percent, an all-time low and significantly less than the 23 percent the bureau reports during obama’s first year in office. this suggests that the choice is not between two very different data sets, but rather two different interpretations of similar evidence. contrary to the stanford-nyu report’s claims, the new america foundation is not underreporting civilian casualties; its researchers have simply chosen not to feign certainty in the face of ambiguity.what they didn’t saythe stanford-nyu researchers also fail to incorporate evidence that might temper their claims. their report makes numerous references to an ap investigative report that interviewed 80 villagers at the sites of the ten deadliest attacks in 2011 and 2012 but neglects its conclusions that \"a significant majority of the dead were combatants\" and the numbers of casualties gathered by ap investigators \"turned out to be very close to those given by pakistani intelligence on the day of each strike.\"numerous media accounts, including the la times, have highlighted that \"the [stanford-nyu] study concludes that only about 2 percent of drone casualties are top militant leaders.\" the study reached no such conclusion. this claim is based on research conducted by new america and published last month on cnn. while the stanford-nyu report summarily dismissed new america’s militant and civilian casualty estimates, they have been quick to make this statistic a centerpiece of their argument. in doing so, they also take the conclusion out of context, and ignore the possible tactical utility of deliberately targeting low-level militants. indeed, destroying communication centers, training camps and vehicles undermines the operational effectiveness of al-qaeda and the taliban, and quotes from operatives of the pakistan-based haqqani network reveal that drones have forced them into a \"jungle existence\" where they fear for the lives on a daily basis.a second key contention of the stanford-nyu report is that drone strikes are \"damaging and counterproductive\" to u.s. national security. however, it is shortsighted to evaluate u.s. security in isolation from pakistani domestic order. terrorist attacks have been a pervasive problem in pakistan, especially since 2007. while the report references these attacks and the frequent assassinations carried out by taliban forces, it makes no reference to recent research by an analyst at the rand corporation, who identifies a negative correlation between drone strikes and militant violence inside pakistan, indicating that the rate of violence has gone down as the rate of drone strikes has gone up. analysis by new america suggests that while only 10 percent of drone strikes target al-qaeda operatives, approximately 50 percent hit taliban targets and in 2009, 19 of the first 32 drone strikes targeted the organization of baitullah mehsud, the leader of the pakistani taliban who was ultimately responsible for the deaths of thousands of pakistanis, and the alleged mastermind of the assassination of former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto. mehsud was a far greater threat to pakistani security than that of the united states.key findingsthese criticisms are not to suggest that the stanford-nyu report is without merit. the anecdotal evidence on the adverse mental health impact of drones, the economic hardships created by attacks and the restriction of movement caused by fata residents’ anxiety about potential strikes are all valuable contributions to the public’s understanding of drones, as is the report’s succinct and cogent summary of some of the key legal issues. both of these topics merit further research and the teams at stanford and nyu seem well poised to continue contributing in these areas.however it would be a mistake to unequivocally accept all of the report’s conclusions or its stance on the civilian casualty debate. the u.s. government’s claims that civilian casualties from drone strikes during obama’s term in office are in the single digits are manifestly untrue, but there is no need to overstate the rate of civilian deaths to make the point that drones strikes are legally suspect and morally hazardous.meg braun is a rhodes scholar and mphil

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0044", "doctext": "santiago, chile - a former top venezuelan security official says video reports from sunday's drone attack on president nicolas maduro demonstrate serious shortcomings in the response of the bodyguards protecting the increasingly embattled leader.\"maduro's security was shown to be deficient,\" said retired venezuelan vice admiral mario carratu, who has headed security teams for previous venezuelan presidents, in a telephone interview with voa. \"his bodyguards were slow to react and seemed to lack an evacuation plan for the president.\"carratu said video of the incident, in which two drones exploded near a reviewing stand without injuring maduro, suggested the president's security detail did not have an effective evacuation plan in place.the former admiral's analysis dovetails with public comments from disaffected former venezuelan military officers who have gone public with claims to have been responsible for the assassination attempt.\"we showed that the regime is vulnerable. we didn't make it, but it's a matter of time before we do,\" said salvatore lucchese, a former caracas police chief now in exile.venezuelan opposition activist salvatore lucchese venezuelan opposition activist salvatore lucchese speaks during an interview with reuters in bogota, colombia aug. 6, 2018. venezuelan opposition activist salvatore lucchese speaks during an interview with reuters in bogota, colombia aug. 6, 2018.lucchese claimed to have been part of the plot in an interview with reuters this week in which he called for an armed overthrow of maduro's leftist regime.maduro was addressing a ceremony of the paramilitary national guard in central caracas when he came under attack from two drones packed with explosives. the government claims that one of the drones was diverted electronically while the second crashed into a nearby apartment building.carratu confirmed that venezuela, a longtime ally of cuba, has the technology to electronically penetrate and interfere with the electronic signals of aircraft. but he ridiculed claims made on twitter by persons saying they were involved in the attack that the drones had been shot down with firearms.\"plastic explosives can't be detonated with bullets. they more likely exploded prematurely due to poor preparations by the hit team,\" he said.lucchese's claim of responsibility for the attack came wednesday but could not be independently confirmed. responsibility has been claimed by a confusing array of spokesmen purporting to represent former and active members of venezuela's security services, going by various names including \"the resistance,\" \"fenix group\" and \"soldiers in t shirts.\"lucchese was jailed by the venezuelan government in 2014 for refusing orders to suppress opposition protests in his city. he took up political activity upon his release in 2016, when he objected to political negotiations with maduro, but fled the country shortly afterward to avoid being arrested again.he did not reveal his location in the reuters interview, but members of the venezuelan government assert that he is in neighboring colombia, a country that maduro accuses of backing attempts to topple him.exiled venezuelan opposition journalist patricia poleo, long known for her close connections with the military, broadcast a statement from miami that she claimed had been issued by officers in venezuela. it said the officers were resorting to \"armed struggle\" because \"the regime has consistently ignored the constitution.\"some opposition leaders have cast doubts on the claims of responsibility, suggesting instead that the attack was staged by the government to justify further repression.julio borges, president of the venezuelan

borges, president of the venezuelan parliament, arrives for a meeting with ernesto macias, president of colombia's senate, at the congress in bogota, colombia, aug. 8, 2018.the maduro government this week has rounded up a half dozen military officers it accused of conducting the attacks and has issued arrest warrants for at least two opposition leaders, including congressional speaker julio borges, who is in colombia.lucchese's police background crisscrossed with that of police lnspector oscar perez,who last year attacked venezuela's supreme court from a helicopter with hand grenades and machine-gun fire. the attack came as the court's seven judges assumed the powers of parliament to allow maduro to rule autocratically.perez also machine-gunned a building housing maduro's new handpicked national assembly, which had just ousted attorney general luisa ortega for accusing maduro of corruption and authoritarian rule.the caracas metropolitan police, which has been largely dissolved by the maduro government, maintained close links with opposition leaders. lucchese was a member of the same christian democratic first justice party as caracas mayor leopoldo lopez, one of the most charismatic anti- government leaders who has been repeatedly imprisoned by maduro.perez was a subordinate to lucchese in the police criminal investigations unit and the special operations brigade. he was killed by the new national secret police, sebin, whose forces used rocket-propelled grenades against his safe house when they raided it some months ago.", "templates":

wants the assembly to strip opposition legislators of their constitutional immunity from prosecution and indicated he eager to prosecute many more members of the opposition parties that control a handful of state governments along with the national assembly, providing one of the few remaining checks on the power of the socialist party that has ruled this opec nation for nearly two decades.\"the right wing already has its prison cell waiting,\" the president said. \"all the criminals will go to prison for the crimes they've committed.\"saying the assembly will begin to govern

the highest-ranking official to publicly split from the president.the trump administration has imposed successive rounds of sanctions on high-ranking members of maduro's administration, with the

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0051", "doctext": "in boston marathon bombing trial, a search for justice and closure cambridge, massachusetts — three short paragraphs - hand-written, in russian, on lined, notebook paper - sat atop a stack of old newspapers next to the television in the newly vacant third floor apartment at 410 norfolk street.federal bureau of investigation agents had done the first of two searches of the east cambridge apartment, rented for more than a decade by an ethnic chechen family, the tsarnaevs.file - this april 15, 2013, photo shows medical workers aiding injured people at the finish line of the 2013 boston marathon following an explosion.days earlier, on april 15, 2013, two pressure cookers, packed with nails and ball bearings, exploded near the boston marathon finish line, killing three, maiming scores and shattering the celebration of the world’s oldest annual marathon.the tsarnaevs’ two sons had been implicated: tamerlan, 26, had been killed during a police shoot-out. dzhokhar, 19, was in police custody.a friend, who had known the tsarnaev family for years and was very close to all of them, discovered the paper in the apartment and recognized the handwriting as tamerlan’s:\"they said: how many small armies had defeated larger armies by the will of allah. the prophet called to allah with the words: give me the perseverance in all my undertakings and the resoluteness to follow the correct path. if allah will give you support, then no one will defeat you. if he removes this support, then who will help you in place of nothing? let the devout rely on allah.\"a scrap of paper, featuring quranic musings, written in russian and shared with voa, was found in the cambridge apartment by a close family friend and identified by the friend as tamerlan's handwriting.the writing, shared exclusively with voa, is a glimpse into the mind of the man considered to be the mastermind of the boston terrorist attack.nearly 21 months later, the scars of the bombing - psychological and physical - are deep and raw in the boston area as survivors, witnesses, americans and chechens, from boston and grozny, have groped to understand the motivations of the tsarnaev brothers.voa has retraced some of the key steps leading up to the bombing, interviewing members of the chechen émigré community and others who had close dealings with the tsarnaev family.the story that emerges is one of a troubled family buffeted by the challenges of adapting to american culture and by the undercurrents of war and radicalism wracking their ethnic homeland.dzhokhar tsarnaev is seen in this law enforcement bulletin, distributed in the days after the april 15, 2013, bombing.the best hope, however, for understanding what led to april 15, 2013, lies with dzhokhar tsarnaev, whose trial on 30 terrorism and related charges opens monday in boston’s federal court just a few miles from the marathon’s finish line.“they took the innocence from us, that they did take,” said jason rosenberg, a boston-area lawyer who represents a man once cared for by the tsarnaev family. “you think you’re immune from [terrorism], it only happens elsewhere.”“we think: ‘they can’t be these beasts, but we all know that a human being … can be caring and loving to someone else and then be a horrendous person,” he said. “you can be, and are, one and the same, the same person.”‘why did you do it, tamerlan, why?’a caring and loving person is what tamerlan seemed like less than four weeks before the bombs sent panic through runners and spectators lining the few hundred yards along boston’s boylston street leading up to the finish line.around march 20, tamerlan, along with his american wife, katherine, traveled to the outskirts of manchester, new hampshire, to visit another chechen family who had fled the region in the early 2000s: musa khadzhimuradov, his wife madina, and their two children.among the two dozen or so chechen families living in boston and southern new hampshire, it was common to mark holidays together, to attend one another’s barbecues, to carry on traditions from back in chechnya. tamerlan had come, khadzhimuradov said, to say goodbye to khadzhimuradov’s mother-in-law, who was returning to chechnya.khadzhimuradov, who formerly worked as a bodyguard to chechen separatist leader akhmed zakayev, said he had been in touch with tamerlan since 2006, when they met at a chechen holiday celebration in boston. at 755 boylston st., just a few steps from the finish line of the boston marathon, there is little indication of the carnage of the 2013 bombing, except for a small makeshift memorial tied to a narrow tree.during the march visit, both khadzhimuradov and his wife madina recalled, tamerlan played happily with his young daughter zahara, and chatted with the khadzhimuradovs’ own daughter.“we didn’t talk about war or religion, nothing,” musa khadzhimuradov told voa. “he was happy. maybe he had a double life or something, but he was playing with his child.”“the way [katherine] looked at him, she couldn't take her eyes of him,” madina said. “tamerlan was chatting, playing with his daughter.” “i see him almost every night in my dreams,” she said. “he looks just as always: very handsome and calm. i cry and i ask him: ‘why did you do it, tamerlan, why?’ and he answers: ‘i didn't want to do it here.’”but according to fbi affidavits, the grand jury indictment and other details made public in media reports, tamerlan was plotting something destructive.on at least two occasions in the months prior to april 15, tamerlan had visited a manchester firing range just a few miles from the khadzhimuradov apartment to practice shooting. on march 20, dzhokhar, who was a student at the university of massachusetts dartmouth, joined tamerlan at the range.carey mcloud, an owner and manager of the manchester firing range line, refused to answer voa’s questions about the tsarnaev brothers.tamerlan had also traveled to the new hampshire coastal town of seabrook to buy fireworks, and gather gunpowder to fuel the pressure cooker bombs. on february 6, at around 7:40 p.m., tamerlan stopped at phantom fireworks and paid $199 cash for a package called “lock and load,” and took advantage of a “buy-one-get-one-free deal.” he left with 48 mortars and the equivalent of eight pounds of low explosive powder, according to prosecutors.on feb. 6, 2013, tamerlan tsarnaev traveled to new hampshire, to buy fireworks, as part of preparations to build pressure cooker bombs.“he asked ‘what was the loudest, most powerful firework we had?” store manager april walton told voa. “it’s what 80 percent of our customers ask for.”sometime around april 5, just 10 days before the bombings, tamerlan went online and ordered electronic components that could be used in making bombs, according to the grand jury indictment. those components were delivered by mail to the norfolk street apartment.in recent years, some members of the tsarnaev family, including the boys’ mother zubeidat, had begun openly expressing their muslim faith. they dressed in traditional conservative clothing and attended prayer services, mainly at the islamic society of boston’s cambridge mosque four blocks from 410 norfolk street. once a fashionable and flashy dresser, zubeidat had taken to wearing headscarves, long skirts and long-sleeved dresses and shirts. she reportedly started wearing gloves constantly so as to avoid touching the hands of unrelated males, such as shop clerks or tollbooth workers. the tsarnaev boys’ sisters, bella and ailina, also began wearing headscarves.outburst at the mosqueprior to november 2012, the tsarnaevs didn’t stand out among the hundreds who attended prayers regularly, said the cambridge mosque’s acting imam, ismail fenni.that month, a guest speaker gave a sermon about the importance of muslims accepting public holidays like thanksgiving. tamerlan stood up and angrily interrupted the speaker, calling him wrong.fenni said he and other elders spoke to tamerlan and reminded him of the mosque rules of behavior and decorum. tamerlan nodded and said he understood, fenni recalled.elders at the cambridge mosque of the islamic society of boston said the november 2012 outburst by tamerlan tsarnaev was the first time anyone really took note of him.then in january 2013, at the prayer service before the martin luther king jr. holiday, tamerlan again stood up and interrupted the sermon, as the guest speaker discussed how muslims should accept the civil rights leader.“there was nothing really for us to be worried about with him before his explosive outbursts,” fenni said. “before then, he was just a face in the crowd.”that first outburst had occurred four months after tamerlan returned from a trip to russia’s north caucasus, where chechnya is located.between january and july 2012, tamerlan spent some of his time in makhachkala, the capital of the dagestan region, working with his father anzor, who had arrived in the region in april. anzor was newly divorced from zubeidat, according to the family friend, who asked not to be identified publicly while discussing the tsarnaev’s family dynamics.like much of russia's north caucasus, dagestan, shown here in red, has struggled with violence spilling over from neighboring chechnya.the stated reason for tamerlan’s trip in january 2012, according to the russian newspaper novaya gazeta, was obtain a russian passport: tamerlan held a kyrgyz passport, the result of his early childhood in kyrgyzstan, where many chechens lived after being expelled from their homeland by stalin in the 1940s.but last year, irina gordienko, an investigative reporter for novaya gazeta, reported that tamerlan didn’t actually apply for a passport until the end of june, more than six months after arriving.gordienko also reported tamerlan had been in contact with two militants wanted by russian security agencies. one, a russian-canadian named william plotnikov, was killed by police on july 14, 2012. within two days, tamerlan left the region to fly back to the united states.“people in dagestan told me he dressed strangely, his behavior was unusual,” gordienko said. “he wasn’t very knowledgeable about islam.”where tamerlan (l) saw some success as a boxer, dzhokhar (r) captained his high school wrestling team.in the united states, tamerlan had been a show-off from a young age, always seeking attention, the family friend told voa. he loved to sing, to play violin and to dance. he was smart academically, but he never seemed focused, the friend said: he talked about being an accountant, but he took only a handful of classes at bunker hill community college.tamerlan was athletic, as well: he trained at a boxing club in somerville, next door to cambridge. his boxing career, nurtured by his father anzor, hit a high point in february 2010 with a regional trophy. then it petered out.“he didn’t seem to know where he was going,” the friend said.over the years, tamerlan pulled income from short-term jobs.in 2009, he worked as a driver for a watertown-based elder care facility that catered to russian immigrants. he also helped his mother with her work as a home health aide in the newton home of donald and rosemary larking.donald larking was an older man who became so close to tamerlan that he attended prayer services at the cambridge mosque, according to rosenberg, larking’s lawyer. larking also had constant discussions with tamerlan about politics and espoused dark conspiracy theories about the attacks of september 11, 2001.through rosenberg, donald larking refused to be interviewed for this article.pictured is tamerlan (c) tsarnaev, accompanied by his father anzor (l), mother zubeidat and uncle muhamad suleimanov (r), in this photo courtesy of the suleimanova family.tamerlan was interviewed by the fbi in 2011, at the request of the lead russian security agency, the fsb, which had been monitoring tamerlan’s alleged interactions with radical groups. chechnya had by then suffered through the second of two wars since 1994, and the turmoil had spawned a terrorist insurgency, influenced by islamic extremists, that had affected the entire north caucasus.according to an fbi statement, the russians reported that tamerlan “was a follower of radical islam” and “had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the united states for travel to the country’s region to join unspecified underground groups.”the youngest tsarnaevdzhokhar, by contrast, was considered smart but quiet, always in his older siblings’ shadow, according to friends and acquaintances.when the family moved to the boston area, dzhokhar, then 8, spent second grade at an elementary school in needham, a boston suburb. he lived with the family of a prominent chechen doctor, khassan baiev.baiev’s daughter maryam remembers dzhokhar, who later called himself jahar, as a happy boy who was good at math, who liked to rollerblade and bicycle around the neighborhood playground.as they grew older, however, she said she had few interactions with him, only occasionally by facebook.“i remember when i saw him on tv… i ran straight to my brother, and said, “did you see who was on tv?’ he said “yeah, i saw it,’” baieva, 21, said. “i was more upset. i felt bad for [dzhokhar] and i felt bad for his parents, everything he put them through.friends say dzhokhar tsarnaev was smart and quiet, always in the shadow of his older siblings.“i felt heartbroken, betrayed at the time. it was scary, because i didn’t know how people were going to look at me after, what people were going to think of me afterward,” she said.unlike with tamerlan - the trip to russia, the mosque outburst, the initial fbi investigation - dzhokhar’s involvement in the attack was even more baffling. according to friends and acquaintances, he never elicited attention or worry prior to april 15, 2013: not from neighbors or friends, not from school, not from law enforcement.at cambridge’s rindge and latin high school, dzhokhar was known as low-key, laid-back and friendly. he was captain of the public school’s wrestling team, an honor student and the recipient of a small scholarship from the city of cambridge.at the dartmouth campus of the university of massachusetts, dzhokhar was known as a middling student and, according to the boston globe, an active dealer of marijuana.“dzhokhar kept to himself, he was smart. he made his own choices,” the family friend said. “he wasn’t the center of attention; he was always off to the side.”“i never worried about dzhokhar,” the friend said.in the months immediately before the bombing, the norfolk street apartment was occupied only by tamerlan, his wife and their daughter. katherine worked as a home health aide. his parents were both living in russia. his sisters had moved out.on the dartmouth campus, according to prosecutors, there were indications that dzhokhar was exploring violent acts. sometime in the spring of 2013, dzhokhar downloaded to his computer several books and pamphlets espousing radical islamist ideas.one was a book that contained a passage by a well-known al-qaida propagandist, anwar al-awlaki. another was a copy of the summer 2010 issue of inspire magazine, an english-language publication by al-qaida’s affiliate on the arabian peninsula.the issue contained detailed instructions about making a pressure cooker bomb using common materials in an article titled: “how to make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom.”fireworks found inside a backpack belonging to dzhokhar tsarnaev are seen in a handout photo released by the fbi, may 2, 2013.after his arrest, investigators later found dzhokhar’s college dormitory room, his computer and a backpack containing fireworks that had been emptied of gunpowder.the night of april 15, dzhokhar sent a friend— the son of a prominent boston-area chechen émigré— a text message asking him if he was at the marathon and was ok.on april 18, as police widened their search for the alleged bombers, the brothers shot and killed a police officer at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge, according to the grand jury indictment. hours later, as the manhunt began closing in, dzhokhar sent another text message to a college classmate saying: “if you want u can go to my room and take what you want.”in the early hours of april 19, with tamerlan dead and the suburban town of watertown resembling a war zone, dzhokhar, bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds, huddled in a boat parked in a backyard driveway.inside the hull and on an overhead beam, he scrawled several messages that give some insight into his motivations, according to the indictment:“the u.s. government is killing our innocent civilians; i can't stand to see such evil go unpunished; we muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all; now i don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in islam.... stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.”trial as closurefor victims, for friends of the tsarnaev family, for chechen immigrants, for marathon runners, for arguably just about everyone in massachusetts, the trial scheduled for monday is likely to be a riveting spectacle.file - demonstrators asserting that evidence in the boston marathon bombing was fabricated stand outside the federal courthouse ahead of a pre-trial conference for suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev in boston, dec. 18, 2014.for some, it will be a chance at vengeance and punishment for a young man whose seeming potential crashed to a halt on april 15, 2013.for others, it will be a chance at learning something more about why a laid-back, average, 19-year-old college student decided to participate in a horrific attack on bystanders celebrating a beloved sporting event.“i want to know why he did it. i want to know why he would go out of his way, what did he need when he already has everything,” said baieva, the childhood friend.on december 18, dzhokhar appeared at the john joseph moakley united states courthouse, on boston’s waterfront, his last appearance before the formal beginning of his trial. it was his first public appearance since july 2013, when, still visibly wounded from the manhunt, he told the court he entered a plea of not guilty.a courtroom sketch depicts dzhokhar tsarnaev in federal court in boston, massachusetts, december 18, 2014.during the 30-minute appearance on december 18, dzhokhar – sporting a shock of bushy hair and a thin beard – played nervously with his hands and smiled occasionally when talking with his lawyers.he stood when the judge addressed him directly, and he responded respectfully, saying “yes, sir,” and “no, sir.”federal prosecutors have indicated they will seek the death penalty if dzhokhar is convicted. his defense lawyers are expected to seek leniency from the jury, arguing that dzhokhar was an accomplice, but decidedly under the sway of his older brother.defense lawyers have also made a flurry of last-minute court filings, seeking to either delay the trial or move it out of state. a filing last monday by tsarnaev’s lead lawyer, judy clarke, suggested that the defense was trying reach a deal with the prosecution: possibly a guilty plea in exchange for a life prison sentence.“if the government remains unwilling to relent in seeking death, and the case therefore must be tried, the defense is asking for nothing more than a trial that is fair,” she wrote.a couple embraces at a memorial on boylston street to the bombing victims, april 21, 2013.the trial portends renewed grief not only for the victims of the bombing. for the refugees of the chechen wars and oppression, who came to the new england over the past two decades, settling in the united states was a chance for them to rebuild a semblance of peace and prosperity. the boston marathon bombings shattered that dream.upon reaching the united states, “for the first time in my life i felt that i, my kids, my family – that we are safe and happy here. i prayed for america every evening,” said madina khadzhimuradova, the tsarnaev family friend.“now it is all gone. i am living in fear again, just like in the old times in chechnya. we spoke about moving somewhere else, but where can we go? there is no place for chechens on this earth.”", "templates":

colombia (farc).but an explosion of a car bomb of this size is something that has not happened in a long time in bogotá and it took the city by surprise, bbc mundo colombia correspondent boris miranda

survived an alleged assassination attempt via drone on saturday when a flying device carrying explosives detonated during a speech he was delivering in caracas.maduro, an unpopular leader who has presided over one of the worst economic collapses in latin america in recent history, blamed the \"far right,\" including colombian president juan manuel santos, for the attack.here’s what happened: on saturday evening, maduro was addressing the crowd at a military parade celebrating the 81st anniversary of the national guard when a flying device approached and exploded, according to venezuelan officials.footage of the event, which was broadcast on live television, shows maduro look up mid-speech, while his wife cilia flores, who is standing behind him, flinches.for a few seconds, no one appears to react, as they seem to be processing what’s happened.\"seconds later, there was a second explosion,\" maduro said in a national address recounting the incident.then the crowd disperses and people flee.some images on twitter capture the chaos and aftermath.quisieron poner a prueba lealtades-de la fuerza armada y del pueblo sobre todo- y ya ven que somos infranqueables a la hora de

attempt to kill me,\" maduro later said in a retelling of what happened.\"today they attempted to assassinate me.\"firefighters at the scene disputed that account, however, telling the associated press that a gas tank had exploded nearby.maduro, 55, said he believed the attempted attack was part of a right-wing plot against him that was working with opponents in bogotá and miami, including santos, the outgoing colombian president.he provided no evidence to back up his accusations.the colombian government called maduro’s charges \"absurd.\"other countries expressed support for maduro after the attack, including turkey, syria, nicaragua, and russia.bolivian president evo morales in a series of tweets expressed solidarity with maduro and described the attempt as a \"crime against humanity.\"a little-known group called soldiers in t-shirts claimed responsibility for the act, saying they planned to fly two drones at the president but the devices were shot down.the ap couldn’t verify the claims, and the group didn’t respond to a message from the outlet when it reached out for comment.national security adviser john bolton said in an appearance onfox news sundaythat the united states had \"no involvement\" in the incident.\"if the government of venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of us criminal law, we’ll take a serious look at it, but in the meantime i think what we really should focus on is the corruption and oppression in the maduro regime in venezuela,\" he said.the political situation in venezuela is badmaduro, a former bus driver who took over as president after former president hugo chávez died in 2013, has overseen a catastrophic economic collapse in venezuela.the socialist economy, once thriving, has spiraled since global oil prices dropped in 2014.venezuelans suffer from widespread food and medicine shortages, and the majority of the country is living in poverty.seventy-five percent of the country’s population lost an average of 19 pounds of bodyweight between 2015 and 2016, and the international monetary fund expects inflation in venezuela to reach 13,000 percent in 2018.thousands of venezuelans are fleeing the country.yet maduro remains in power.he won reelection in may due to a largely rigged election.he banned two of the most popular opposition leaders, leopoldo lopez and henrique capriles, from running against him, and implied that any venezuelans who didn’t vote for him could lose government food subsidies.his election is likely to worsen the economic crisis in venezuela: instead of electing a reformer who might enact the measures necessary to pull the country out of the state it’s in right now, such as addressing its currency exchange policy and diversifying the economy away from oil dependence, the country now has maduro for another six years.and he remains defiant — in the face of opposition, or alleged assassination attempts.update: story updated with comments from john bolton.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "attack", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["nicolás maduro", 21]]], "Instrument": [[["drone",

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0061", "doctext": "venezuela’s beleaguered government appeared prepared to go ahead with a vote on sunday that critics at home and abroad have warned will seal the demise of the oil-rich nation’s democracy.at least five people were killed last week after the opposition stepped up its protests against the controversial vote that will elect a 545-member constituent assembly with the power to rewrite the constitution and dissolve state institutions.a government ban on public demonstrations in the run-up to the election reduced turnouts for nationwide protests called by the opposition, but sporadic looting and clashes between protesters manning barricades of tree branches and barbed wire were reported in several cities on friday night.q&a why is there unrest in venezuela? show • at the heart of the crisis is a cratering economy and acute shortages of medicine and food, coupled with rising anger at a soaring crime rate and an increasingly authoritarian government • the president, nicolás maduro, won a general election in 2013 on a platform of continuing his predecessor hugo chávez's socialist policies of using the country's oil riches to reduce inequality and lift people out of poverty, but falling oil prices have forced the government to curtail social programmes • opposition activists have been staging unrelenting protests against the government.despite the continuing threat of repression, the opposition coalition, known as mud, called for mass demonstrations in caracas on sunday while voting takes place.“tomorrow we rebel,” tweeted freddy guevara, vice-president of the opposition-held national legislature, whose power to legislate was hamstrung by a supreme court decision in april, prompting the protests.at least 113 people have been killed, and more than 2,000 wounded, in constant street protests since april, triggering president nicolás maduro’s decision to create the assembly.maduro has said the assembly will help bring peace to the sharply divided country where, despite its oil wealth, many venezuelans are going hungry because of food shortages and spiralling inflation. but the opposition said it is little more than a power grab to consolidate the ruling socialist party’s grip. it is boycotting the assembly and demanding general elections instead.“on 30 july, the constitutional assembly will happen,” maduro said. “i’ve been loyal to chávez’s legacy. now it’s your turn.”an attempt at brokering an agreement by the former prime minister of spain, josé luis rodriguez zapatero, to avert the increased tensions appeared to have failed. zapatero issued a statement on saturday tacitly acknowledging that the constituent assembly vote would be held, but calling on the assembly’s powers to be limited and for firm dates for local and presidential elections to be set.“today and tomorrow are transcendental for venezuela,” zapatero said in the statement. he called on the government to make “new gestures” to help ease tensions but did not call for the vote to be cancelled.the opposition also appeared resigned to seeing the vote take place. “but we are not backing down because our problem is not the constituent assembly, it is the dictatorship,” said guevara in a statement.“what comes after sunday will not be easy for us,” he said, adding however that the “deepening of the crisis will affect those in government much more”.but polls show that 70% of venezuelans do not want a constituent assembly, although turnout on sunday may not reflect that. to avoid an embarrassingly low turnout, government officials and pro-government neighbourhood committees have been warning that people who do not show up for the vote may lose their jobs, essential food subsidies or homes.delcy leonor medina, a 52-year-old housekeeper, said she and her neighbours in a working-class district of caracas face the threat of armed muggings and murders.now they face an added threat of losing their government-subsidised homes if they don’t vote. but she remained defiant. “i’m not giving that bastard anything. if the constituent assembly is voted in, i may have to leave here,” she said.many of venezuela’s 2.8 million state workers have reported getting text messages, phone calls and being required to attend political rallies during work hours, according to reuters.early on saturday, the opposition coalition’s website appeared to have been hacked, showing a message saying “yanquis, leave our america” with a photo of the us president, donald trump. hours later, the site showed a message reading “democracy cannot be hacked.”cilia flores, maduro’s wife and a candidate for the assembly, said the new body with supra-legislative powers would create a commission to punish those responsible for the political upheaval. they will “pay and learn their lesson”, she said, playing on the fears of the opposition that they will suffer further persecution.diosdado cabello, the first vice-president of venezuela’s socialist party, said the assembly will strip legislators in the opposition-controlled national assembly of their immunity from prosecution. he said the office of venezuela’s chief prosecutor, who recently became one of maduro’s most outspoken critics, would be “turned upside down”.the us has led other nations in imposing targeted sanctions against 13 current and former officials close to the government. they were followed by similar measures by mexico and colombia.us vice-president mike pence spoke by phone with opposition leader and political prisoner leopoldo lópez, sentenced to 14 years for inciting violence, charges human rights groups have said were trumped up. pence told lópez, who was transferred to house arrest earlier this month, that the united states “stands with the venezuelan people”.the trump administration has threatened further measures if the vote goes ahead, which may target the country’s oil industry, one of the few economic lifelines left in venezuela.colombia’s president juan manuel santos, who is often the target of maduro’s public rants of an international conspiracy against him, said he would not recognise the constituent assembly, which he called “spurious”.in a tacit recognition of the growing humanitarian and political crisis, the colombian government said on friday it was granting a special permit for venezuelans already in the country to remain for up to two years.and more than one venezuelan is preparing to pack his bags and join the growing number of people fleeing.carlos, a 24-year-old student at the metropolitan university in caracas, said most of his friends are leaving the country. his parents have said that if the constituent assembly is voted in, they want him to join them. “i would lose my family, my home, my friends, my university,” said carlos, who declined to give his real name. but he also holds another fear. “i’m afraid of losing my country,” he said.additional reporting by

and to release its own data on the level of civilian casualties inflicted through the use of remotely piloted aircraft, together with information on the evaluation methodology used.\"", "templates": [{"incident_type": "attack", "Attacker": [[["cia", 12]]], "Target": [[["civilian", 31]]], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "die", "Victim": [[["civilian", 31]]], "Place": [], "Killer": [[["cia", 12]]], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [[["drone", 168]]], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": [[["pakistan", 748]], [["country", 1198]]]}, {"incident_type": "die", "Victim": [[["2,200 people", 1253]], [["civilians", 1311]]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["civilians", 1311]], [["civilians", 1311]]], "Injurer": [[["royal air force", 2394]]], "Instrument": [[["aircraft", 601]]], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "attack", "Attacker": [[["royal air force", 2394]]], "Target": [], "Instrument": [[["aircraft", 601]]], "Place": [[["afghanistan", 706]]]}]}

victims and their families.sir peter thornton qc is challenging a high court ruling which ordered him to reconsider his decision to exclude an enquiry into the identities of those who “planted, planned, procured and authorised the bombs”.the bombings in two city centre pubs, widely believed to be the work of the ira, killed 21 people and injured 182 – making it the deadliest peacetime attack in the uk at the time.for the reasons the coroner gave ... these inquests cannot resolve the enduring injustice. peter skelton qc, for the coroneroutlining his submissions to the court of appeal, peter skelton qc said: “the 21 people who died in the bombings and their families have suffered an enduring injustice.“so too have those who were injured and their families, and countless others who have been affected.“the pain and grief they have borne has been exacerbated by the fact no-one has ever been held accountable in law.“but, for the reasons the coroner gave … these inquests cannot resolve the enduring injustice.”mr skelton, representing the coroner, added that the victims, their families and the public interest “cannot be served” by a promised resolution that “cannot be delivered”.two high court judges quashed a decision by sir peter to exclude the “perpetrator issue” from the new hearings following a judicial review brought on behalf of the bereaved families by julie hambleton, whose sister maxine was 18 when she was killed in the bombings.ten of the families were in court on tuesday to hear the appeal before the lord chief justice, lord burnett, lady justice hallett and lord justice mccombe.they are also arguing it is necessary for the inquests to investigate the perpetrator issue because the police investigation into the bombings resulted in a “notorious miscarriage of justice”.six men, known as the birmingham six, were imprisoned for the murders and served 17 years behind bars in one of britain’s most infamous miscarriages of justice before their convictions were quashed.five west midlands police officers were charged with perverting the course of justice in connection with the original criminal investigation, but a judge ruled in 1993 that a fair trial would be impossible.there has never been an effective and independent investigation into who was responsible for the atrocity hugh southey qc, for the famileshugh southey qc, representing the families, said there was the “most pressing need for a thorough investigation”.he told the court: “the actions of west midlands police officers in the investigation and subsequent criminal convictions are often considered to be the worst miscarriage of justice in british legal history.“there has never been an effective and independent investigation into who was responsible for the atrocity.“there is no prospect of such an investigation occurring, apart from within the inquest.“despite that, the appellant decided not to investigate the issue of who was responsible.”mr southey later added: “there is the utmost public interest in the proper investigation of who was responsible for the birmingham bombings.“the families of the deceased said to the appellant that the investigation of this issue was so important to them that if it did not form part of the scope of the inquest ‘we may as well not have an inquest at all’.”speaking before the hearing, mrs hambleton said: “it will be utterly redundant to have the inquests unless the perpetrators, their associates and those who prepared and planted the bombs are included.”she said supporters of the families’ campaign group justice4the21 have so far raised £75,000 for the case after mrs hambleton was refused legal aid.the group held a demonstration outside the royal courts of justice in london in february,

bombings in jakarta by islamist militants.bali police tuesday say they received an anonymous letter warning that the resort island will be the next target for a terrorist assault.\"the letter was sent by an anonymous individual to buleleng district, and the police are still conducting an investigation, and trying to find out who sent the letter. but again, i urge people in bali not to be afraid, but they should stay alert,\" said bali police chief sugeng priyanto.authorities say they've increased security at shopping malls and other locations that draw crowds in bali.in 2002, the popular resort island was targeted by jemaah islamiyah (ji), an indonesia-based terrorist group with links to al-qaida. the bombing of a club in bali killed 202 people, mostly foreigners.the bali bombing severely hurt indonesia’s tourism industry, and began a decade of deadly plots in indonesia carried out by southeast asian militants affiliated with al-qaida.indonesia successfully combated the ji related terrorist threat through police action, intelligence operations and high profile criminal prosecutions.however, after last week's attack in the center of jakarta that killed eight people, including four militants, indonesian security forces are raising concerns that more and deadlier attacks could follow, carried out by groups inspired by islamic state.indonesian special police patrol at ngurah rai airport in denpasar on indonesia's resort island of bali on jan. 15, 2016, one day after a series of explosions hit the indonesian capital jakarta.the jakarta attack was the first of its kind in southeast asia to be attributed to syria-based militant islamists.authorities say about 500 indonesians have travelled to the middle east to join the extremist group. about 100 are believed to have returned, although experts say only about 15 have combat experience.jakarta back to normalso far the renewed threat of terrorism has not instilled any widespread sense of panic or fear amongst indonesians.a security personnel stand guard inside train carriage for women at manggarai train station in jakarta, jan. 8, 2016.life in jakarta has quickly returned to normal, less than a week after the deadly attacks.on tuesday the starbucks coffee shop that was bombed remained closed and boarded up for repairs, but the memorial of flowers had been removed. other shops have reopened and traffic at the busy intersection was congested as usual.'ojek' herothe “ojek” motorcycle taxi drivers were again gathered at the intersection where the attack took place, waiting for their next fares.one of the “ojek” drivers back at work is muhamad yunus, who has received widespread praise for the selfless courage he exhibited during the attack.the militant attackers last thursday (january 14) set off two bombs, the first at the starbucks and the second at a police traffic station in the middle of the intersection, near jakarta's oldest department store, sarinah.after the second explosion yunus rushed to the police station to help the wounded even though the assailants were shooting at anyone in the area. he said he found a woman whose legs were severely injured and brought her to safety, away from the firefight.“i got that woman and i told her, don’t cry. please be strong. be strong. please don’t be sad,” yunus said.yunus said he found out later that the woman and her nephew were stopped by the police for a traffic violation at the time of the blast. her nephew died in the explosion.kami tidak takutafter the jakarta attack there have been demonstrations by indonesian muslims to denounce terrorism and call for the government to eradicate radical militants and supporters of islamic state in the country.a \"pray for jakarta\" message (top) is displayed on a screen as indonesians gather outside the damaged starbucks coffee shop in central jakarta on jan. 17, 2016 following the deadly gun and bomb attacks that rocked the city on jan. 14.indonesians also have started to use hashtags like \"prayforjakarta\" and \"kamitidaktakut\" or \"wearenotafraid\" in english, on social media.yunus’s act of heroism has been held up as an example of indonesia’s resolve to stand up against terrorism.“i am not afraid. we won’t be scared any more,” he said.dismantling terror networksmeanwhile indonesian authorities have promised to intensify their efforts to monitor radical networks in the country.police believe the alleged mastermind of the jakarta attack, an indonesian fighting with islamic state in syria called bahrun naim, used social media to communicate his radical ideas to followers in indonesia.in december police say they successfully disrupted plans by militants to launch a string of deadly attacks on christmas and new year celebrations, as well as against the country's shia muslim minority.prior to last week, the last major attack in the world's most populous muslim nation was the twin bombing of luxury hotels in jakarta in 2009.ade irma in jakarta

blasting cap routinely used at construction and mining sites across the country.the blasting cap is the only ingredient in the deadly mix, the experts and law-enforcement ofﬁcials say, that requires a license or permit for purchase, and most probably was stolen.manuals were foundthe investigators said they found manuals for bomb making in one of the apartments that they raided after arresting mr.salameh.neil c.livingstone, the president of the institute on terrorism and sub-national conﬂict in washington, said that as a test of how easy it was to obtain such guides to destruction, he recently wrote to a publishing house using a child's lined notepad and a crayon.three of the bomb-making manuals were promptly delivered to the address mr. livingstone had given, he said, no questions asked.though building the bomb was relatively easy, the experts say, it was not by any means free of danger.the bulkiest part of the bomb, they say, was extremely stable and could only have been touched off with a tremendous kick, like that provided by nitroglycerine.making the nitroglycerine, by blending some of the chemicals, was the trickiest part of the process.as the chemicals are mixed to form this compound, said dr. per-anders persson, the director of the center for explosives research at the new mexico institute of mining and technology, they get hot and may explode.often, he said, beakers are packed in dry ice to keep the chemicals at a safe temperature.a dangerous mixthe nitroglycerine could have also exploded prematurely with any jolt or sharp change in temperature, the experts said.the bombers risked blowing themselves up as well, the experts said, when they hooked up the wires connecting the bomb's trigger with the blasting cap.dr.robert h. kupperman, a senior adviser for science and technology at the center for strategic and international studies at georgetown university, said that perhaps the greatest skill in making the bomb came in rigging the chain of triggering explosives so they all tore into the bulk of the bomb for maximum effect, as investigators at the world trade center say apparently happened.so far, in more than a week of searching, they have not found a single grain of the main explosive material.sulfuric acid widely soldwilliam lazor, a senior technical consultant at the du pont company in wilmington, del., said that sulfuric acid is the most widely sold chemical in the united states, used in the manufacture of everything from battery acid to detergents and shampoos.dale ladysh, another consultant at du pont, said that nitric acid is only slightly behind in popularity.it is used, he said, in the electronics industry and for making stainless steel and many industrial dies and pigmentations.both acids are commonly used metal cleaners.according to rick amberg of amberg perennial farm and garden center in westﬁeld, n.j., urea is often scattered over lawns to make them grow lustrously, and is also used in making plastics.mr. amberg sells a plastic 50-pound bag of urea for $20.99.in newark, the dooner & smith chemical company sells a 15-gallon drum of sulfuric acid, weighing 172 pounds, for $41.28.the same size container of nitric acid costs $44 and weighs 220 pounds.\"whoever put that thing together really intended to do a lot of damage,\" said mr.roy.\"this kind of explosive device is often used to fracture and move rock.it expands slowly with great force.\"", "templates": [{"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["world trade center", 93]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [[["bomb",

in an assault on fort hood in november 2009.like hasan, abdo may have taken some of his inspiration from anwar al-awlaki, a radical american-born islamic cleric who is among the leaders of the yemen-based al qaeda in the arabian peninsula (aqap). one senior u.s. official told abc news that after abdo was arrested at a killeen, texas hotel wednesday, abdo mentioned the name of al-awlaki.nidal hasan had exchanged emails with awlaki, according to u.s. authorities. al-awlaki is believed to have inspired several other terror plots in the u.s. as well, including the bungled christmas day underwear bombing of northwest flight 253.according to senior law enforcement officials, when police searched abdo's hotel room, in addition to firearms, ammunition and bomb-making materials, they also found an article from a jihadi magazine produced by al-awlaki's organization, al qaeda in the arabian peninsula.the officials told abc news abdo had apparently stashed in the room an article from the first issue of al qaeda's \"inspire\" magazine called \"how to build a bomb in the kitchen of your mom.\"aqap, a media-savvy affiliate of al qaeda, has produced six issues of \"inspire\" so far, each featuring praise for martyrs and instructional sections on firearms and explosives for the prospective terrorist.abdo was charged friday with the federal crime of possession of a non-registered firearm in addition to previous charges of possession of child pornography and going awol from his unit. as he was being led from the courtroom, he yelled out, \"nidal hasan!\",

and he was charged with having child pornography on his government-issued computer. military investigators had been looking at abdo's computer files after he made \"radical statements,\" law enforcement sources told abc news.after he was told he would face a court martial, abdo went awol from fort campbell on july 4. though vocal in his protestations against the mission in the middle east, abdo did not make any public threats against the military.but when he was discovered wednesday, abdo was apparently in the final planning stages of a deadly attack. he was caught in part because a wary local gun store owner called police after abdo visited the store to buy ammunition and gunpowder. he was acting \"suspicious,\" guns galore owner greg ebert told abc news.\"there was clearly something wrong with him,\" ebert said. \"we made a decision to call the police and fortunately it worked out.\"after his arrest, abdo admitted he planned to plant two bombs at a local restaurant frequented by fort hood soldiers and hoped to gun down any survivors of the dual blast, according to law enforcement documents obtained by abc news.according to the documents, military officials

everything is quiet!” she is heard to say.the government appears to be using the plot to pursue political opponents who may have nothing to do with it, an approach it has used in the past. it has at times arrested opponents and accused them of sabotage as the economy and basic services have collapsed. in the past, the plots were mostly invented for political purposes; now they’re increasingly real.in the past two weeks, the government has announced the arrests of two high-ranking national guardsmen, a congressman and almost a dozen other people, many younger than 30.the venezuelan justice organization, a human-rights watchdog, says there are currently about 150 servicemen and women behind bars.soldiers in t-shirtsone group claiming responsibility for this month’s attempt is a network of online activists called soldados de franela, or soldiers in t-shirts, named after the way street protesters hide their faces. the escaped plotter, however, doesn’t think they are the people he met with in bogota.what is clear is the depth of despair spreading across venezuela as it descends into a lawless failed state where crime is rampant, those who can are leaving and hunger gnaws away at many of the nation’s remaining 30 million inhabitants. for at least a year, there have been multiple small-scale rebellions, largely unconnected.officials say as many 34 people, including opposition leaders and former student protesters, conspired in the drone attack. the president was unharmed, but much of the country watched on live television as hundreds of soldiers scattered following the off-camera explosions, deeply embarrassing the government.juan requesens source: afp tv/afp via getty imagesamong the detainees are a general and colonel of the national guard and the congressmen, juan requesens. he has been charged with attempted homicide and treason. the government has released a video of requesens, 29, that shows him apparently answering an interrogator and acknowledging participating in the plot. his party says he was coerced and drugged. another video his supporters leaked shows him in a state of ruin, almost naked in what appears to be soiled underwear.20 more suspectsauthorities are now seeking an additional 20 suspects, including a lawmaker in exile, who are at large across latin america and in the u.s.the government has named as one of the leaders julio borges, the former head of venezuela’s opposition-led congress, who fled to colombia earlier this year. borges has denied involvement and said the attacks were perpetrated from within the government’s own ranks.soldiers in t-shirts formed following a wave of anti-government unrest in 2014. its website and social-media accounts have been popular among demonstrators and resistance groups for updates on protests and news critical of the government.in 2017, soldiers in t-shirts began disseminating messages and videos of oscar perez, an elite police officer who commandeered a helicopter and called upon venezuelans to rise up against the government. security forces killed him in january in an hours-long shootout that was, in part, broadcast across social media.one of the soldiers in t-shirts leaders, who gave his name as gregory, confirmed perez’s death the day of the raid in an interview with cnn en espanol. whatever their role in the most recent attack, he said, the group is growing.“this is not a defeat,” he said. “the government wants to view it as a trophy, but there are more of us. we are thousands.”— with assistance by fabiola zerpa, and noris soto", "templates": [{"incident_type": "crime", "Perpetrator": [], "Victim": [], "Place": [[["where", 3538]], [["venezuela", 93]]]}, {"incident_type": "die", "Victim": [[["him", 729]]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "charge", "Prosecutor": [], "Defendant": [[["he", 4222]]], "JudgeCourt": [], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [[["perpetrators", 1036]]], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["maduro", 220]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [[["explosives", 854]]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "arrest", "Jailer": [], "Detainee": [[["several", 1189]]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "arrest", "Jailer": [[["it", 1556]]], "Detainee": [[["opponents", 2526]]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "charge", "Prosecutor": [[["it", 1556]]], "Defendant": [[["them", 2656]]], "JudgeCourt": [], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "arrest", "Jailer": [[["the government", 184]]], "Detainee": [[["high-ranking", 2892]], [["a", 44]], [["other people", 2958]]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "meet", "Participant": [[["the people", 997]], [["participant", 919]]], "Topic": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "arrest", "Jailer": [], "Detainee": [[["women", 3105]], [["servicemen", 3090]]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}]}

country’s interior minister, and the political architect of britain’s counter-terror system, as more details emerge of the three attackers and what security agencies knew about them before their van-and-knife rampage saturday in the heart of london.ahead of thursday's vote in a snap post-brexit parliamentary election, which may called with the expectation of securing a landslide victory, the terror attack is undermining the air of dogged competence may carefully crafted as the country's home secretary, a post she held for six years and relinquished on becoming prime minister last year.britain's prime minister theresa may speaks outside 10 downing street after an attack on london bridge and borough market left 7 people dead and dozens injured in london, june 4, 2017.foreign minister boris johnson conceded tuesday that there were questions to answer about how the three militants slipped through the intelligence net. he was speaking as police named the third attacker as 22-year-old italian-moroccan youssef zaghba, who was on an italian watchlist and suspected of being a foreign fighter.born in fez, morocco, in 1995 to an italian mother and a moroccan father, zaghba was stopped by italian police at the bologna airport on march 15 of last year after arousing suspicions he was going to join the islamic state terror group to fight in syria.italian officials say he had a one-way ticket to istanbul and was carrying just a small backpack. his cell phone, which was seized, contained jihadist content, including pictures and videos, and he was placed on a watchlist as a suspected foreign fighter. italian officials say they shared intelligence on him with both the british and moroccan security agencies.lived in britainthe last few years zaghba lived in britain, where he worked on and off at a restaurant and a hotel near regents park, traveling back and forth to visit his mother, who lives in bologna.the naming of the third islamic militant came after it emerged earlier tuesday that the ringleader of saturday’s attack, 27-year-old british-pakistani khuram shazad butt worked for a man accused of helping to train the islamic extremists responsible for the july 7, 2005 underground train bombings in london, britain’s first islamist suicide attack. fifty-two people were killed across britain’s capital in the coordinated strike and more than 700 others were injured.this is undated three photo combo handout photo issued by the metropolitan police on tuesday june 6, 2017 of khuram shazad butt, left, rachid redouane, centre and youssef zaghba who have been named as the suspects in saturday's attack at london bridge.counterterror analysts say they are surprised that butt remained a \"low priority\" for the security services despite his close connections to sajeel shahid, a 41-year-old who ran an all-muslin gym in east london and was named in a new york court case as having helped to set up weapons training in pakistan for the july 7 suicide bombers.“it was a blunder to have downgraded the terror threat in britain so quickly after the manchester bombing,” said olivier guitta, managing director at globalstrat, a security and geopolitical risk firm. he says with election campaigning under way coinciding with ramadan, the muslim holy month, the chances of attacks were always high.guitta, who has advised government in the past on counterterrorism, said, “no one should be surprised by the terrorism wave and which is linked to a policy of laissez-faire policy toward extremists.”the main charge leveled against may by labour politicians and the leaders of the country’s smaller parties is the large cuts she introduced on funding for britain’s police. those cuts resulted in police personnel being drawn down from 2010 to 2016 by more than 20,000 officers.uncertain election impacton monday, the opposition parties received support for their criticism from an unlikely quarter. conservative insider steve hilton, the policy guru of former prime minister david cameron, demanded may resign over what he termed “security failures,” which he said led to saturday’s attack and the bombing of a concert last month in manchester.he said may should be “resigning, not seeking re-election.”pollsters are wary of predicting how the terrorist attacks — three in the past 10 weeks — will impact the voting on thursday, but labour leaders say they have renewed hope at the very least of reducing the ruling conservative’s majority as they seek to recast their campaign message in the final hours before voting as “investment versus cuts.”on sunday, may promised to review britain's counterterrorism strategy, holding out the prospect of enhanced powers for the security services and longer prison sentences for extremists. may said she wants to take a tougher line with internet providers and social media businesses that allow extremist material on their sites.she warned there has been “far too much tolerance of extremism” in britain and promised to step up the fight against islamist terrorism after the london bridge attack, saying “enough is enough.”video sizewidthxheightpixelsbritain pm may: 'enough is

according to assistant police commissioner mark rowley, he had seen “nothing to show that a poor decision has been made” in 2015 and that police had no evidence butt was planning anything.police, however, confirm they received several warnings from neighbors and associates about butt.british police and mi5 set up in 2013 an early warning system, known as project danube, to help them spot when low-priority suspects might be re-engaging in violent extremism. that program appears to have failed, say critics, as it did not help them identify khalid masood, the militant responsible for the

officials are allegedly getting rich off the economic distortions – through exchange rate scams and by selling scarce food on the black market.was this helpful?thank you for your feedback.maduro said the government would still provide direct subsidies to citizens holding the \"fatherland card\", a state-issued identification card that the government uses to provide bonuses and track use of social services.he said the subsidy was only available to those who registered their cars in a vehicle census being conducted by the state.venezuela has dirt-cheap fuel, so why is driving nearly

injured in a car bombing at a colombian police academy in bogotá, recalling the high-profile attacks associated with the bloodiest chapters of the country’s guerrilla and drug conflicts.the scene outside the general santander police academy was chaotic after the mid-morning explosion, with ambulances and helicopters rushing to the normally tightly controlled facility.witnesses said they heard a loud explosion that destroyed windows in adjacent buildings. pictures on social media showed a charred vehicle surrounded by debris on the academy’s campus.the defence ministry said at least nine people were killed and 24 injured. among the dead were a panamanian and an ecuadorian national.alcaldía de bogotá (@bogota) #atención el alcalde @enriquepenalosa se encuentra en la escuela general

gerson, who entered the school two days ago, when he was stopped in his tracks by the blast a block away from the school’s heavily fortified entrance.“i’m sad and very worried because i don’t have any information about my son,” said trujillo, standing outside the facility, where police officers had set up a taped perimeter. “this reminds me of some very sad days in the past.”president iván duque, who was visiting a western state, was rushing back to the capital to oversee the police investigation into what he called a “miserable” attack.“all of us colombians reject terrorism and are united in confronting it,” duque said in a tweet. “we won’t bend in the face of violence.”for decades, residents of bogotá lived in fear of being caught in a bombing by leftist rebels or pablo escobar’s medellín drug cartel. but as colombia’s conflict has wound down, and the nation’s largest rebel group disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.facebook twitter pinterest smouldering remains of car bomb are seen in this screengrab outside bogotá police academy.authorities have yet to suggest who was behind the attack, but attention has focused on leftist rebels from the national liberation army, eln, which has been stepping up attacks on police targets in colombia amid a standoff with the conservative duque over how to restart stalled peace talks.colombian rebels blamed for killing spree 400 miles inside venezuela read morethe group known was long considered a lesser military threat than the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc), whose 7,000 guerrilla fighters disarmed as part of a 2016 peace accord. but in the wake of the peace deal, the cuban-inspired insurgency has been gaining strength, especially along the eastern border with venezuela, where it has carried out a number of kidnappings and bombings of oil pipelines. that has hardened duque’s resolve in refusing to resume peace talks that have been stalled since he took office last august.thursday’s bombing was the deadliest in the capital since an explosion at the upmarket andino shopping mall in june 2017 killed three people, including a french woman, and injured another 11. police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the people revolutionary’s movement for the bombing.but it has been more than a decade since a police or military installation in the capital has suffered a major bombing. a blast at military university in 2006 left almost two dozen people injured.ariel ávila, an analyst who tracks violence, said that in the last four years, there have been 28 attacks in the capital with explosives. while the majority has been carried out with low-grade homemade materials and grenades that have damaged property but left no casualties, he said police intelligence and checkpoints surrounding the city need to be reinforced to prevent more attacks.", "templates":

men who allegedly found a piece of luggage on a new york sidewalk that contained an explosive device that may be tied to the suspect in saturday's bombings in new york and new jersey.on wednesday the fbi issued a statement and a photo of two men that was taken on saturday, september 17, in the same hour an explosive device detonated. the fbi said the men took the luggage, which was located only four blocks or so from the new york bombing site, and left the device behind. that device did not detonate.federal investigators said during a news conference wednesday the men are wanted as witnesses only.federal investigators said earlier the suspect in saturday's bombings in new york and new jersey has been charged with use of a weapon of mass destruction in the weekend attacks. investigators said he bought components on ebay and used as triggering devices cell phones purchased from a store 500 meters from an address he once listed as his home.evidence teams investigate at the scene of saturday's explosion on west 23rd street in manhattan's chelsea neighborhood in new york, sept. 19, 2016. ahmad khan rahami, a u.s. citizen of afghan descent has been charged in the bombing.multiple

sentence of life in prison.authorities arrested rahami on monday after an exchange of gunfire with police that left him and two officers wounded.according to the court documents, investigators believe rahami used an ebay account with the username \"ahmad rahimi\" to buy citric acid, a circuit board, electric igniters and hundreds of ball bearings between june 20 and august 10. the items were shipped to a business in perth amboy, new jersey, where rahami worked until september 12.ball bearings were found in two pressure cooker bombs placed four blocks apart in the chelsea neighborhood of new york late saturday. one of them exploded, injuring 29 people, while the other was recovered intact. investigators said the second bomb had \"numerous\" electric igniters.that second device was tested for fingerprints, and the criminal complaint said all 12 prints found were matches for rahami. the documents say his prints were also found on items inside of a backpack that was discovered late sunday at a train station in elizabeth, new jersey, just outside of new york. the bag contained multiple explosive devices, including one that blew up as police tried to disarm it with a robot.authorities also tied rahami to a bomb that blew up in a trash can in seaside park, new jersey, early saturday.that link involved one of the cell phones that investigators said were shipped last year to a store in perth amboy near the address that rahami provided as his home in a 2012 passport application. they said a second phone shipped to the same place was used in the bomb that blew up in chelsea.a third phone, one found with the other chelsea bomb, was once registered to one of rahami's family members, the documents said.a still image captured from a video from wabc television shows

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0089", "doctext": "accused boston bomber says satisfied with defense lawyersboston — the boston marathon bombing suspect, in his first court appearance in more than a year, told a judge on thursday that he was satisfied with his lawyers' preparations for the january start of his trial over the deadly 2013 attack.dzhokhar tsarnaev, 21, was dressed in a dark sweater and wore his hair shaggy for his appearance at u.s. district court, where he will be tried on charges of killing three people and injuring more than 260 with two homemade bombs at the race's crowded finish line on april 15, 2013, as well as fatally shooting a university police officer three days later.the defendant, who had grown a light beard, appeared in a courtroom packed with victims, supporters and curious onlookers.tsarnaev looked alert and healthy, showing no signs of the injuries suffered during a gunbattle with police on the night of april 18, 2013, that ended with the death of his brother, tamerlan, also accused with playing a role in the attack. in his prior court appearance, in july 2013, tsarnaev's left arm was in a cast and his face appeared swollen.u.s. district judge george o'toole asked tsarnaev if he was satisfied with his defense attorneys in a series of questions intended to avoid any post-trial assertions that he was not provided a proper defense.\"yes, your honor,\" tsarnaev replied briefly to questions about whether his attorneys were keeping him abreast of court developments. he looked somewhat fidgety during the 25-minute hearing.o'toole also said that many of the court documents filed under seal ahead of the trial will be made public after the jury is seated in january.'stay strong'tsarnaev faces the possibility of execution if convicted in a trial that is expected to run for three months. the court plans to weed through more than 1,000 people to find 12 jurors and six alternates to hear the case.at the hearing's conclusion, elena teyer, 45, whose son-in-law ibragim todashev was fatally shot by fbi agents in florida during an interview about his friendship with tamerlan tsarnaev in the weeks after the bombing, shouted support to tsarnaev in russian.outside court, she translated her words for reporters as \"dzhokhar, we know you're innocent ... stay strong, son.\"a resident of savannah, georgia, teyer said she had traveled to boston specifically for the hearing.\"you know how hard it is when you have no one near you who is going to support you,\" teyer said.thursday's hearing is the final pre-trial conference in tsarnaev's case. in the weeks leading up to the trial, prosecutors and defense attorneys are disputing a range of issues including how much they must disclose about the witnesses they plan to call.the tsarnaev brothers had moved to the united states from russia's restive chechnya region a decade before the attack.dzhokhar left a scrawled note inside the dry-docked boat where he was captured in watertown, massachusetts, a day after the shootout, indicating that the marathon attack had been motivated by u.s. military campaigns in muslim countries.tsarnaev's attorneys had asked that the trial be held outside boston, contending that since hundreds of thousands of spectators attend the boston marathon, it would be all but impossible to find an impartial panel of people who had not been present the day of the attack or known someone who had been.o'toole had previously denied that request, noting the court had recently seated juries in other high-profile cases, including the 2013 trial of former mob boss james \"whitey\" bulger, who was found guilty of racketeering and murder.on his way into court, one of the bombing's victims, marc fucarile, confronted a small group of protesters who asserted the evidence of the bombing was fabricated. fucarile grabbed the prosthetic limb that replaced the right leg he lost in the bombing, saying he considered that proof enough.asked about the incident, fucarile said, \"they have a right to their opinion, same as anybody else.\"", "templates": [{"incident_type": "trial", "Prosecutor": [], "Defendant": [[["his", 106]]], "JudgeCourt": [],

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0090", "doctext": "how many us troops were killed by iranian ieds in iraq?far fewer than congress thinks, according to newly declassified documents from u.s. central command.explosively formed penetrators — a particularly deadly form of roadside bomb — killed 196 american soldiers in iraq over a five-and-a-half-year period, according to recently declassified pentagon documents.that’s about half as many deaths as lawmakers have attributed to the bombs, which u.s. officials say were largely supplied by iran’s elite quds force.the carnage wrought by efps returned to the news over the summer, as opponents of the nuclear deal with iran cited tehran’s behind-the-scenes actions against u.s. troops during operation iraqi freedom as a reason to scuttle the agreement.sen. ted cruz, a texas republican who is also running for president, and others in congress have said that efps had killed more than 500 troops.“i understand that the joint personnel recovery agency has a classified list of roughly 500 american soldiers who were murdered by iranian ieds,” cruz said at a july 29 senate armed services committee hearing.but data from u.s. central command, which runs u.s. military operations in the middle east, suggests the actual toll is far less.according to the first comprehensive accounting, between november 2005 and december 2011, 1,526 efps killed a total of 196 u.s. troops and injured 861.between october 2006 and september 2007, efps killed 97 u.s. troops and wounded more than 300 soldiers.efp attacks peaked in march, april and may 2008, near the end of the american troop surge, when 200 of the bombs were detonated.the deadliest month was april 2008, when efps killed 15 u.s. soldiers.the pentagon attributes the presence of efps in iraq to the quds force, the special forces arm of the iranian revolutionary guard led by qasem soleimani.various efp “factories” were found throughout iraq during operation iraqi freedom.still, the exact degree to which iran bears culpability for arming shia militias in iraq with efps and related equipment is a matter of some dispute.“we weren’t always able to attribute the casualties that we had to iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was iranian activity, even though we didn't necessarily have the forensics to support that,” gen. joseph dunford, the incoming chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said at his july 9 confirmation hearing.during the hearing, dunford said the numbers of american soldiers killed by iran “has been recently quoted as about 500.”centcom later clarified that dunford was referring to total american deaths by efps and other iranian weapons.it is “important to understand that the centcom statistics on efp detonations are a subset of all the iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 u.s. troops in iraq during oif,” maj. genieve david, a centcom spokeswoman, said in an email.data about the roughly 300 deaths not caused by efps, including the kind of weapons used in the attacks, is classified, david said.a few weeks later, at the july 29 hearing, gen. martin dempsey, the outgoing joint chiefs chairman, said “several hundred” american forces were killed by efps.phil novack, a spokesman for cruz, told defense one that the senator's office is working with the pentagon to get specific numbers.he said cruz used the 500 number based on dunford's testimony.cruz “asked secretary carter to inform the families of the 500 service members who were killed by iranian efps that their loved ones were murdered by the same man who will now receive sanctions relief,” novack said in an email.“whether the number is 500 lives or 196 is immaterial; the fact remains that general soleimani — a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of american service members — will receive sanctions relief to the tune of millions of dollars if this deal is approved.\"the arrival of efps on the iraqi battlefield around 2005 came as a shock to u.s. planners.along with more run-of-the-mill improvised explosive devices, the deadly bombs drove a crash effort to create and deploy vehicles with far better armor.whereas most roadside bombs send energy and shrapnel in all directions, efps work more like cannons.the force of the blast molds a concave metal disc, called a liner, into a “formed penetrator” which is propelled at up to 3,000 meters per second.the effect is incredibly destructive, even to up-armored humvees.“you can do as much or more damage with a 5-pound efp, which is aimed, as with a 200-pound conventional ied,” a pentagon analyst told los angeles times writer andrew cockburn in 2007.the analyst speculated that the cost to construct such a device was about $30 or less.they’ve been around since at least world war ii, when resistance elements in europe used them against germans, cockburn wrote.among the other iranian arms introduced to the iraqi battlefield is the improvised rocket assisted munition, described in one joint ied defeat organization document as “a rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister — such as a propane gas tank — filled with explosives, scrap metal and ball bearings and propelled by rockets.”first seen in iraq in 2007, the iram — “essentially an airborne version of a roadside bomb — a flying ied” is ”the signature weapon used by iranian-backed militias that operate with the aid of iran’s islamic revolutionary guards group,” the undated document says.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "die", "Victim": [[["troops",

whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or was the act of a malevolent individual.that's what we don't yet know.and clearly, we're at the beginning of our investigation.\"in a post expanding on the memo,time's crowley noted the ease of creating such an explosive device.\"the ability to make these bombs is hardly unique to al qaeda and its sympathizers.details on how to make a pressure cooker bomb can also be found on websites associated with anarchy and other forms of non-religious radicalism,\" he said, before linking to such a website.other evidence suggests that the bombs were made with readily-available chemicals.new scientistasked a bomb expert to study the footage of the explosion for clues of the bombs origin.here's what the expert concluded: \"the boston bombs ... produced an orange flash followed by white smoke.this suggests the bombs contained neither tnt nor rdx, which produce black smoke, but could have been a home-made chlorate-based device.\"update, 5:04 p.m.:abc news is reporting that one of the bombs used gunpowder to detonate.it's unclear how the bombs detonatedin the same report detailing how the bombs were built, the associated press notes, \"law enforcement officials have some of the bomb components but [do] not yet know what was used to set off the explosives.\"in that vacuum of knowledge a number of rumors have appeared: 1) the bombs used a timer; 2) the bombs were activated remotely; 3) cell phone service was shut down in downtown boston to avert other remotely-activated bombs; and 4) a mysterious roof-top figure captured in a single photo hassomethingto do with setting off the bomb.rumor no.1 appears to be the strongest.after speaking to an official close to the investigation, cnn knocked down rumors (discussed below) that the bomb had been detonated using a cell phone-activated trigger, and reported that investigators in boston think the bombs had timers attached to them instead.and, within minutes of cnn's report, theglobereported that investigators had turned up a circuit board they believe was used to trigger the explosions;

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0092", "doctext": "on 4 december 1971, the ulster volunteer force (uvf), an ulster loyalist paramilitary group, detonated a bomb at mcgurk's bar in belfast, northern ireland. the pub was frequented by irish catholics/nationalists. the explosion caused the building to collapse, killing fifteen catholic civilians—including two children—and wounding seventeen more. it was the deadliest attack in belfast during the troubles.despite evidence to the contrary, the british security forces asserted that a bomb had exploded prematurely while being handled by irish republican army (ira) members inside the pub, implying that the victims themselves were partly to blame. a report later found that the police (royal ulster constabulary) were biased in favour of this view, and that this hindered their investigation. the victims' relatives allege that the security forces deliberately spread disinformation to discredit the ira. in 1977, uvf member robert campbell was sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the bombing and served fifteen years.the bombing sparked a series of tit-for-tat bombings and shootings by loyalists and republicans, which contributed to making 1972 the bloodiest year of the conflict.==background==mcgurk's (also called the tramore bar) was a two-storey public house on the corner of north queen street and great george's street, in the new lodge area to the north of belfast city centre. this was a mainly irish nationalist and catholic neighbourhood, and the pub's regular customers were from the community. the pub was owned by patrick and philomena mcgurk, who lived on the upper floor with their four children.the ulster volunteer force (uvf) was formed in belfast in 1966, declaring \"war\" on the irish republican army (ira). until 1971, however, its actions were few and it \"scarcely existed in an organisational sense\". the british army was deployed in northern ireland following the august 1969 riots, which are usually seen as the start of the troubles. in december 1969 the ira split into two factions: the 'official' ira and provisional ira. both launched armed campaigns against the british army, the royal ulster constabulary (ruc) and the government of northern ireland.during 1971, the violence gradually worsened. there were daily bombings and shootings by republicans, loyalists and the security forces. during the first two weeks of december, there were about 70 bombings and about 30 people were killed. on 2 december, three republican prisoners escaped from crumlin road prison, not far from mcgurk's. security was tightened and there was a heavy ruc and british army presence in the area over the next two days. eyewitnesses asserted that the checkpoints around mcgurk's were removed just an hour before the attack.==bombing==on the evening of saturday 4 december 1971, a four-man uvf team met in the shankill area of belfast and were ordered to bomb a pub on north queen street. according to the only convicted bomber—robert campbell—they were told not to return until the job was done. campbell said that their target had not been mcgurk's, but another pub nearby. it is believed this was a pub called the gem, which was allegedly linked to the official ira. the  bomb was disguised as a brown parcel, which they placed in a car and drove to their target. campbell says they stopped near the gem at about 7:30pm, but could not gain access to it because there were security guards outside. after waiting for almost an hour, they drove a short distance to mcgurk's. at about 8:45pm, one of them placed the bomb in the porch entrance on great george's street and rushed back to the car. it exploded just moments after they drove off. campbell implied that mcgurk's had been chosen only because it was \"the nearest catholic pub\".the blast caused the building to collapse. bystanders immediately rushed to free the dead and wounded from the rubble. firefighters, paramedics, police and soldiers were quickly on the scene. fifteen catholic civilians had been killed—including two children—and a further seventeen wounded. the rescue effort lasted many hours.within two hours of the blast, a sectarian clash had erupted nearby at the new lodge–tiger's bay interface. the british army and ruc moved in and a gun battle developed. a british army officer, major jeremy snow, was shot by the ira on new lodge road and died of his wounds on 8 december. two ruc officers and five civilians were also wounded by gunfire. eventually, five companies of troops were sent into the district and they searched almost 50 houses.meanwhile, the uvf team had driven to a nearby pickup point where they dumped their car. they walked to the area of st anne's cathedral and were picked up by another. they were driven back to the shankill and met the man who had ordered the attack in an orange hall, telling him that \"the job has been done\".among those killed were philomena and maria mcgurk, wife and 14-year-old daughter of the pub owner patrick mcgurk. patrick and his three sons were seriously injured. shortly after the attack, mcgurk appeared on television calling for no retaliation: \"it doesn't matter who planted the bomb. what's done can't be undone. i've been trying to keep bitterness out of it.\"==investigation=====responsibility===after the bombing, the media reported various theories about who was responsible. the main theories were:*that it had been planted by loyalists;*that it had exploded prematurely while being prepared by ira members inside the pub;*that it had exploded prematurely while \"in transit\", an ira member having left it in the pub to be collected by another ira member; and*that it had been planted as part of a feud between the provisional ira and official ira.the security forces promoted the idea that it was an ira bomb which exploded prematurely (an \"own goal\"). survivors and relatives denied this. they said the pub was not associated with the ira and there had been no suspicious people or activity in the pub that night. an intelligence corps document from december 1971 also said that the pub was not known to have ira associations. on 6 december, both wings of the ira condemned the attack, denied responsibility and blamed the uvf and security forces.====claims of responsibility====that same day, several newspapers received telephone calls from someone claiming to be a spokesman for the \"empire loyalists\". their statement to the belfast telegraph was:we [the empire loyalists] accept responsibility for the destruction of mcgurk's pub. we placed 30lb of new explosives outside the pub because we had proved beyond doubt that meetings of ira provisionals and officials were held there. the \"empire loyalists\" had made only one other claim of responsibility; for bombing a community centre on 12 november. the ruc, however, had no intelligence about such a group; suggesting that it may have been a covername.on tuesday 7 december, a youth claimed to have seen a man acting oddly at a phone kiosk the night before. he said the man was wearing a jacket with a uvf badge on it. the youth claimed to have checked the kiosk after the man left and found a torn bit of paper. when put together, it included the lines:we the empire loyalists wish to state that we did not destroy mcgurk's public house as an act of retaliation ... furthermore we do not require the forensic experts of the army to cover up for us ... we shall not issue any further statements until we exterminate another rebel stronghold.in the days following the bombing, the ruc received a letter signed by \"chief of staff, uvf\" claiming that the uvf bombed the pub because an ira meeting was due to take place there. it said that two uvf members entered the pub, had a drink and asked the barman to mind a package while they \"ran an errand\". witnesses told the ruc, however, that there had been no strangers in the pub and that nobody had left a package. three other unsigned letters were sent to the ruc, claiming it was an ira bomb \"in transit\" and that two ira members were killed.====location of the bomb====for the ruc, the location of the bomb (whether it exploded inside or outside) became the key to finding who was responsible. however, investigators (both ruc and british army) were unsure and gave conflicting opinions.ruc duty officers' reports were made daily. their purpose was to brief the chief constable and others at hq about events that had happened that day. the reports were also made available to the british army's general officer commanding for northern ireland. the 4–5 december 1971 report said of the bombing: \"just before the explosion a man entered the licensed premises and left down a suitcase, presumably to be picked up by a known member of the ira. the bomb was intended for use on other premises. before the 'pick-up' was made the bomb exploded\". the origin of this information could not be established.on 6 december, however, the ruc took a witness statement from an 8-year-old boy. he said that a car had stopped outside the pub with four men inside and \"a wee union jack stuck in the back window\". he said one left a package in the great george's street doorway and ran back to the car, which sped off just moments before the package exploded. a man and a woman backed up his story, although they did not witness as much as the boy. despite this, the security forces and the government stood behind the \"own goal\" theory. a british intelligence corps document covering the period 8–15 december said: \"it has been confirmed that it was a [provisional ira] bomb which was destined for another target, but exploded prematurely.\" a ministry of defence (mod) document dated 14 december said that this \"should be publicised\". on 23 december, the british army sent a letter (signed by a lieutenant colonel) to people living in north belfast. it said that when the ira in the area is destroyed, \"we can look forward to … a period in which you will not lose your friends in a repetition of the [ira's] accident in the mcgurk’s bar.\"===arrest and conviction of robert campbell===in march 1976, the ruc received intelligence that linked uvf member robert campbell and four others to the mcgurk's bombing. campbell was arrested on 27 july 1977 and held at castlereagh ruc base. he was interviewed seven times during 27 and 28 july. he admitted his part in the bombing but refused to name the others. campbell's story matches that given by the young boy witness.on 29 july 1977, campbell was charged with the 15 murders and 17 attempted murders. on 6 september 1978 he pleaded guilty to all charges and received life imprisonment with \"a recommendation to serve no less than 20 years\", in part for a separate conviction for the murder of a protestant delivery driver in 1976. he is the only person to have been charged for the bombing. he eventually served fifteen years in prison and was released on 9 september 1993.===collusion claims and police ombudsman's investigation===the victims' relatives campaigned for an independent investigation of the bombing as they believed that the ruc's investigation was flawed from the outset. moreover, they wished to disprove the claim that the victims were ira members killed by their own bomb (the \"own goal\" theory). even after campbell's conviction, the \"own goal\" theory remained officially unchallenged. relatives argued that this theory was promoted as part of a \"government policy to avoid publicly acknowledging the loyalist campaign of violence\". another argument is that it was promoted to undermine the ira's support and stir tension between the two ira factions.relatives also asked how the bombers were able to plant the bomb and flee despite the usually heavy security presence. some alleged that the security forces helped the bombers by removing checkpoints. the 2009 book killing for britain, written by former uvf member 'john black', claimed that the british undercover unit known as the military reaction force or military reconnaissance force (mrf) organized the bombing and helped the bombers get in and out of the area. the bombers' original target, the gem, was associated with the official ira. it is claimed that the mrf ordered the team to bomb the gem, with the intention of blaming it on the provisional ira. the plan was allegedly to start a feud between the two ira factions, which would both divert them from their campaign against british forces and drain their support. however, as the gem had security outside, they bombed the nearest 'catholic pub'.on 21 february 2011, the police ombudsman for northern ireland published a report about the bombing and the ruc's investigation of it. the report said that there is no evidence that the ruc helped the uvf bombers. however, it found that the ruc investigation was biased in favour of the view that the ira was responsible. it failed to give enough thought to the possible involvement of loyalists, and this bias hindered the investigation. the report also found that ruc gave \"selective\" and \"misleading\" briefings to the government and media, which furthered the idea that it was an ira bomb. the ombudsman has not found an explanation why successive chief constables have not addressed this mistake. ombudsman al hutchinson said: \"inconsistent police briefings, some of which inferred that victims of the bombing were culpable in the atrocity, caused the bereaved families great distress, which has continued for many years\".on 6 december 2012, scottish labour mp michael connarty - whose uncle was killed in the bombing - claimed in westminster that then-prime minister edward heath \"may have been involved\" in wrongfully blaming the ira and spreading the story. connarty also urged david cameron, prime minister at the time, to apologise to victims and launch a full investigation.==remembrance==in 2001 a memorial was unveiled on the site of mcgurk's bar to mark the 30th anniversary of the bombing. relatives of the victims called for an investigation into allegations that british forces helped the bombers. almost a thousand people attended a service at st patrick's church on donegall street, after which fifteen wreaths, one for each victim, were carried by relatives leading a silent candlelit procession to a new memorial at great george's street.patrick mcgurk died on 15 december 2007, having forgiven those responsible for the explosion and having prayed for the men who carried out the attack.==see also==*dublin and monaghan bombings*glasgow pub bombings*timeline of ulster volunteer force actions==references====external links==* the true

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0095", "doctext": "multiple outlets, law enforcement officials, and president obama responded throughout a manic monday with news that a horrific looking scene made clear in downtown boston, even as a frenzied search for more potential explosive devices continued and hospitals rushed to help survivors: the crowd at the finish line of the boston marathon was bombed twice in what is being described as both a coordinated \"event\" and \"an act of terror\" with more than 140 people brutally injured at eight boston hospitals and at least three dead, including a young child.indeed, even as a city and a nation came together amidst the chaotic scene, there was not much good news in boston this april 15 — the annual patriot day, a massachusetts festival holiday with schools and offices closed for the marathon and, on this particular day, tragedy in the happiest of places.the fbi has taken over \"a potential terrorist investigation,\" fbi special agent in charge richard deslauriers said at a monday evening press conference.\"there is no suspect\" at the hospital, boston police commissioner ed davis said at the briefing, despite reports to the contrary — and speculation that there was still one or multiple persons of interest being questioned at the hospital.when asked if there was a person of interest at the hospital, delaurio declined to comment; he also declined to comment on a wall street journal report that there were five additional devices, which was soon clarified to note that \"investigators now doubt the devices were bombs\" — just one of many conflicting reports citing anonymous law enforcement officials as the investigation began.(and that's not counting the conspiracy theories.)after the death toll had stood at two for much of the day, davis confirmed at the evening event that \"at least three people have died\" in the marathon bombing.governor deval patrick said \"we are asking that everyone be at a state of heightened vigilance\" as boston planned to re-open on tuesday, though he said it \"will not be business as usual.\"boston police and the fbi were scheduled to hold another news conference at 9:30 a.m. tuesday morning.at a late afternoon press conference with patrick, davis initially reported a third explosion at jfk library in boston, which has since been given the all-clear as a separate fire.at a second police briefing, davis said \"we have no suspect in custody,\" as cnn reported that the fbi had classified the event as a terrorist attack.senate intelligence committee chair dianne feinstein classified it as a \"terrorist incident\" that \"could be be foreign, could be homegrown.\"at a white house briefing shortly after 6 p.m. eastern time on a quiet day in washington, president obama reiterated that federal and local investigators are still in the investigation phase.he did not use the words \"terror\" or \"terrorist\" or \"attack,\" instead using the words \"unnecessary loss\" — \"america will say a prayer for boston tonight,\" he said — before delivering a more forceful message:we don't yet have all the answers ...we still do not know who did this or why...but make no mistake we will get to the bottom of this.we will find out who did this ... and any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice.nbc news and others reported that the white house said the bombings would be \"approached as an act of terror.\"both obama and vice president joe biden will meet with secretary of defense chuck hagel on tuesday.as the investigation continues and news reports continue to make sense of the fallout, you can follow the boston police scanner, the boston globe live blog, and the local cbs, abc, and fox stations — as well as some solid twitter lists.the basic details of the bombings, however, are starting to come into focus.after two explosions hit at around 2:50 p.m. boston police would go on to confirm at least three dead — nbc news cited law enforcement officials as saying one was an eight-year-old child, a report confirmed by the boston globe — and 141 injuries.as for the two bombs that caused the carnage, it appears they were fairly unsophisticated devices, perhaps pipe bombs stuffed with ball bearings, which doctors later reported pulling out of victims' flesh.abc news reported that the explosions were triggered by remote detonation, but there's still strikingly little known about the other specifics.meanwhile, there were gruesome images and raw footage from copley square area to makeshift tents, from boston hospitals to instagram feeds, of lost limbs, hair on fire, children with severe burns, and worse.scroll down for all the details on the victims, the persons of interest, the moment of horror, and eyewitness accounts.you can follow all of the atlantic wire's ongoing boston marathon bomb coverage right here — and our day two aftermath updates here.the casualtiesthe boston marathon is tracking runners here, and for those looking for information on loved ones, here are the best ways online.also, phone numbers: for families of victims, call 617-635-4500; for tips, call 1-800-494-tips.the boston chapter of the american red cross said on monday evening that there was no need for additional blood donations \"at this time\" as their shelves were full.the red cross also opened a disaster response center for the recovery effort.reports of casualties are largely unconfirmed and varying, but here they are, updated in relative real time.in a monday night press conference, dr. peter fagenholz, a trauma surgeon at mass.general hospital, explained that most of the casualties were vascular, bone-related or soft tissue injuries, and that there had been \"several\" amputees.fagenholz explained that he started his day in surgery at 8 a.m., and after the explosion worked nonstop until the press conference.other local hospitals — some of the best in the nation — are flooded:injury count as of 745 pm by hospital: boston children’s 8; brigham 27; bmc 23; mgh 22; bi 21; st e's, 15; tufts 9 — the boston globe (@bostonglobe) april 16, 2013an update at the official law enforcement press conference monday night put the casualty count at 141 injured, at least 15 of them critically.cnn reported that at least ten limbs were lost due to the explosions and doctors were picking ball bearings, a common shrapnel generator in pipe bombs, out of victims.the new york post reported 12 casualties, and is further reporting that authorities say a suspect in detention is a saudi national—officials have not confirmed this and boston pd has not confirmed this.cbs news is reporting that boston pd has video of someone \"bringing multiple backpacks to blast site.\"there are various reports on twitter of a suspect being detained, but davis, the police commissioner, maintainted taht \"we have no suspect in custody,\" seeming to cast doubt on reports quoting a federal law enforcement official in the post and elsewhere.among the reported 141 injured a nine-year-old girl, a seven-year-old boy, a 12-year-old, and a two-year-old, according to the boston globe.of the three dead, one is reportedly an eight-year-old boy.the \"person of interest\"for now, boston police say that there are no suspects, but when asked about scattered reports about a person of interest, officials — including the new fbi investigator — would not comment, though law enforcement officials maintain, however anonymously, that there are several active leads.throughout the day and ahead of other media outlets, a law enforcement official kept telling the new york post about a \"saudi national\" as a potential suspect or person of interest, leading to many questions as well as similar reports from fox news.another report in the los angeles times said one person — not a \"suspect,\" but apparently a saudi national — was being questioned.\"a federal law enforcement officials said authorities were questioning a saudi national who was taken to a boston hospital with injuries,\" the report reads.\"the person was not identified as a suspect.\"later on monday evening the globe reported that authorities were \"questioning person of interest in marathon bombings at brigham and women's hospital\" but did not provide any details about the person's nationality.however, the paper maintains, \"the situation remains fluid and it remains too early to establish the cause and motivation.\"officials didn't offer much more clarity at the official press conference on monday night and appear to be approaching the situation with caution.the new york times reports, \"although investigators confirmed that they were speaking to a saudi citizen, several law enforcement officials took pains to note that no one was being held in custody.\"meanwhile, the fbi is asking for people to send in any info — photos, video, tips — or to call 1-800-call-fbi with information regarding the explosions.the investigation remains in the early stages, and the public is clearly pouncing on any sign of a lead.reports of a police search at a revere, mass.condo complex between five and six on monday night lit up twitter.however, it's unclear if the search was related to a bombing or not.the other devicessoon after the initial explosions, boston globe photographer david l. ryan reported that he heard but did not see a third explosion, and boston police were scrambling to contain the scene.\"there were two booms heard from near the finish line\" reports the ap.a spokeswoman at the fairmont copley plaza hotel, close to the explosion, says that it was around two blocks away, while the boston globe said that police were conducting a \"controlled explosion\" on the 600 block of boylston street.over the course of the afternoon and evening, police say they found five additional devices along the marathon route, though a police source later said it was unclear if they were actually bombs.that number does not include numerous reports of suspicious packages around boston and neighboring cities.the boston globe reported another device found near harvard, and there was a bomb threat phoned in near the financial district.there were also reports of undetonated devices being found as far away as newton, though local police have denied those claims.again, the journal walked back its initial claim of the five unexploded devices.and then there was the library fire, which had a whole back-and-forth narrative of its own.here's an updated interactive map of the at times confounding activity, including multiple reported incidents about unconfirmed devices, fires, and all the explosions throughout monday, both alleged and confirmed, for a sense of scale in downtown boston and beyond — even as the day seemed to settle on the two explosions near the finish line:the fbi said on monday evening that local police and federal agents would sweep the entire length of the course to look for evidence and additional devices.meanwhile, the navy has sent an explosive ordnance disposal team to help with the effort.the pictures and video of the explosionhere are a couple of many images to flow in from social media early on:explosion at coply twitter.com/boston_to_a_t/… — boston to a t (@boston_to_a_t) april 15, 2013and one more:just heard that bombs went off at #boston marathon finish line twitter.com/chanyasulkit/s… — chris chanyasulkit (@chanyasulkit) april 15, 2013here is perhaps the most shocking, dramatic, and up-close video from the bombings, via the globe:here is the moment of impact for the first of the two confirmed explosions, by way of twitter's vine, right near the sidewalk (scroll down for video of both):we're going to link to these next two shots (warning — they are graphic) since they show the chaos and some of the injuries, and there are a few very graphic images that have been uploaded to reddit.necn's jackie bruno reports that the injuries there are gruesome:i saw people's legs blown off.horrific.two explosions.runners were coming in and saw unspeakable horror.— jackie bruno (@jackiebrunonecn) april 15, 2013to be sure, this is a time to be good to each other.because there are as many unconfirmed reports and speculative ideas (cbs news reported that certain terrorist target areas are being monitored in boston, and the secret service set up a perimeter around the white house) as there are graphic images.there are amputations.here are some of the first photos to hit the ap wire (warning — it is graphic):this photo from reuters photographer john tlumacki quickly became the iconic image of the day:check out this tumblr post where you can see tlumacki taking the photo.and one more from the boston globe:boston marathon explosion twitter.com/globedavidlrya… — david l. ryan (@globedavidlryan) april 15, 2013here are more photos from the atlantic's in focus blog.here's video of the first explosion:and another close-up video from the explosion:here's how a marathon runner saw things:and here's another angle with a second explosion in the distance.here is the photo of obama on the phone with fbi director robert mueller (official white house photo by pete souza):here is text of president obama's full remarks at the white house.adding further heartbreak to utter tragedy, the 26th mile marker in this year's marathon was actually dedicated to the victims of newtown.the eyewitness accountsthe size of the crowd has yielded countless eyewitness accounts of the horrific scene.one of the more powerful ones we've read comes from the new york times, which spoke to rhode island state trooper and former marine roupen bastajian.\"these runners just finished and they don’t have legs now,\" said bastajian.\"so many of them.there are so many people without legs.it's all blood.there's blood everywhere.you got bones, fragments.it's disgusting.\"several of those reporting on the explosions were actually runners in the marathon, so there is no shortage of eyewitness accounts.two worth reading come from the wall street journal reporter coleen mccain nelson and boston globe photographer john tlumacki.our own richard lawson, a boston native, describes what the scene of the end of the marathon is like on a typical year:marathon monday is one of boston's most celebratory days, with schools and offices closed and people lining the streets cheering runners on for essentially all 26.2 miles of a course which works its way further and further into town.by the time the boston marathon reaches the final stretch down narrow boylston street, it has entered the busy commercial district of copley square.the historic boston public library is on the runners' right, ahead of them the open area of copley square park and the famous trinity church.and of course the culmination of all that is the final downtown stretch, as spirited and jovial a scene as there is in boston at any time throughout the year.the crowd on marathon day is dense and varied — locals and tourists and running enthusiasts from all over show up hours ahead to secure a good view of the finish line.and of course, there are the runners themselves, still streaming across the finish line for hours after the big winners are crowned.—richard lawsonas the day wound down and everyone struggled to process what had happened, astronaut chris hadfield sent a sympathetic dispatch from the international space station.\"a somber spring night in boston,\" he said, including this aerial photo of the city:closer to home, some folks at mit paid

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0098", "doctext": "the 2001 shoe bomb attempt was a failed bombing attempt that occurred on december 22, 2001, on american airlines flight 63.the aircraft, a boeing 767-300 (registration n384aa) with 197 passengers and crew aboard, was flying from charles de gaulle airport in paris, france, to miami international airport in the u.s. state of florida.the perpetrator, richard reid, was subdued by passengers after unsuccessfully attempting to detonate plastic explosives concealed within his shoes.the flight was diverted to logan international airport in boston, escorted by american jet fighters, and landed without further incident.reid was arrested and eventually sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years, without parole.==incident==as flight 63 was flying over the atlantic ocean, richard reid – an islamic fundamentalist from the united kingdom, and self-proclaimed al-qaeda operative – carried shoes that were packed with two types of explosives.he had been refused permission to board the flight the day before.passengers on the flight complained of a smoke smell shortly after meal service.one flight attendant, hermis moutardier, walked the aisles of the plane to locate the source.she found reid sitting alone near a window, attempting to light a match.moutardier warned him that smoking was not allowed on the airplane, and reid promised to stop.a few minutes later, moutardier found reid leaning over in his seat, and unsuccessfully attempted to get his attention.after she asked him what he was doing, reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match.he was unable to detonate the bomb: perspiration from his feet dampened the triacetone triperoxide (tatp) and prevented it from igniting.moutardier tried grabbing reid twice, but he pushed her to the floor each time, and she screamed for help.when another flight attendant, cristina jones, arrived to try to subdue him, he fought her and bit her thumb.the  tall reid who weighed about 215 pounds (97kg) was subdued by other passengers on the aircraft and immobilized using plastic handcuffs, seatbelt extensions, and headphone cords.a doctor administered diazepam found in the flight kit of the aircraft.many of the passengers only became aware of the situation when the pilot announced that the flight was to be diverted to logan international airport in boston.two f-15 fighter jets escorted flight 63 to logan airport.the plane parked in the middle of the runway, and reid was arrested on the ground while the rest of the passengers were bussed to the main terminal.authorities later found over 280 grams (10 oz) of tatp and petn hidden in the hollowed soles of reid's shoes, enough to blow a substantial hole in the aircraft.he pleaded guilty, was convicted, sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years without parole and incarcerated at supermax prison adx florence.== aftermath ==six months after the crash of american airlines flight 587 in queens, new york on november 12, 2001, mohammed mansour jabarah agreed to cooperate with american authorities in exchange for a reduced sentence.he said that fellow canadian abderraouf jdey had been responsible for the flight's destruction, using a shoe bomb similar to that found on reid several months earlier.this claim remains unsubstantiated by the investigation into the cause of the crash; jabarah was a known colleague of khalid sheikh mohamed, and said that reid and jdey had both been enlisted by the al-qaeda chief to participate in identical plots.in 2006, security procedures at us airports were changed to have people remove their shoes before proceeding through scanners, in response to this incident.the requirement was phased out for some travelers, particularly those with tsa precheck, in the 2010s.flight number aal63 continues to be used on the route from paris to miami.==external links==* bomb on flight 63 telegraph media group

domineering older brother. he’s a murderer. he’s a terrorist.that’s the picture presented in recent days of dzhokhar tsarnaev as his defense lawyers neared the end of their effort to save their client’s life. as early as monday, the defense may rest their case and put their faith in the 12-person jury, which will decide whether he should die or live.tsarnaev, 21, was convicted last month of 30 terrorism and other related charges for his role in the april 2013 boston marathon bombing. u.s. law requires that the jury must return a unanimous decision in order to execute a person, and it is that chance – that one juror will decide against the death penalty – where tsarnaev’s lawyers are placing their hopes.dzhokhar tsarnaev, shown in january 2007, holding the daughter of his grade school teacherthree people died in the attack, including an 8-year-old boy, and more than 260 were wounded. tsarnaev and his older brother, tamerlan, killed a police officer several days later just prior to a car chase and shootout that left tamerlan dead.penalty phasethe two-part trial entered the “penalty” phase april 21, as prosecutors sought to paint tsarnaev as a willing accomplice in the worst terrorist attack on u.s. soil since sept. 11, 2001.defense lawyers portrayed their client as a malleable participant, under the sway of tamerlan, who they said was the mastermind and leader.“the whole goal of the defense is … to make the jury see the defendant as a vulnerable human being,” said robert dunham, executive director of the washington-based death penalty information center.“the jury doesn’t have to like him,” he said. “the jury doesn’t have to want to have him over to their house for dinner. they just have to decide that putting him away in a dark hole for the rest of his life is an acceptable punishment.”as with the previous phase, the courtroom has been whipsawed by testimony, by turns infuriating, wrenching, maddening or saddening.prosecutors stunned spectators and jurors in their opening arguments for the death penalty by juxtaposing photographs: of the youngest victim, 8-year-old martin richard, and that of tsarnaev, making an obscene gesture to a video camera in the prison cell where he’s being held.“this is dzhokhar tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged,” federal prosecutor nadine pellegrini told jurors.courtroom tearson monday, less than two weeks later, the courtroom filled with sobbing, when tsarnaev’s aunt, patimat suleimanova, flown from russia, wracked with tears, tried to speak about her nephew whom she hadn’t seen in more than a decade.during the weeks that the trial has been ongoing, tsarnaev, who spent his childhood shuttling between russia and kyrgyzstan and then his formative years in a three-bedroom, third-floor apartment in cambridge, massachusetts, has been largely impassive and at times appearing bored.on monday, after listening to his aunt, he himself broke down for the first time, rubbing his eyes with his fists and openly weeping.not long after, as he was being led from the courtroom during a break, he blew a kiss to a cousin who was in attendance.south boston resident joe kebartas, holding a sign reading \"death penalty is murder,\" demonstrates outside the federal courthouse where boston marathon bombing suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev has been convicted on all 30 counts, april 8, 2015.more than 40 witnesses appeared during the penalty phase, including some of tsarnaev’s former school teachers and college friends, some crying openly. during her appeareance in court on april 29, one former teacher, becki norris, smiled at tsarnaev, and he returned the smile.later, she posted a photograph on facebook of 12-year-old tsarnaev holding her newborn daughter.“when you care deeply for someone, that doesn't stop even if they do unfathomably horrible things. we humans are really good at holding two irreconcilable ideas in our psyches at the same time. yes, he did the unforgivable. and yes, i still love him. and – this one is hard to fathom, i know – he still needs love,” norris wrote on her facebook page.death penalty decisionthe decision by the obama administration to seek the death penalty for tsarnaev has been controversial. massachusetts state law does not allow for capital punishment, but tsarnaev is being tried in federal court.support for the death penalty in the state has never been strong, and public opinion polls taken by boston-area media in the months prior to and during the trial have shown dwindling enthusiasm.on the eve of the final phase, the boston globe published a front-page letter from martin richard’s family, in which they called for sentencing tsarnaev to life in prison.this undated photo provided by bill richard shows his son, martin richard, who was among the at least three people killed in the explosions at the finish line of the boston marathon, apr. 15, 2013.“as long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours,” the family wrote. “the minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and tv screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family.”at the beginning of tsarnaev’s trial, his defense, led by renowned lawyer judy clarke, conceded his guilt, in what appeared to be a strategy focused more on saving his life. “this is the theory: that no person is only the worse thing they’ve done in their life,” said quin denvir, a former federal defender who worked with clarke in gaining a life prison sentence for theodore kaczynski, the “unabomber,” in a federal trial in 1998.“it’s all part of letting the jury seeing the person as a human being, not just the perpetrator of a crime, but as a fully developed human being, with strengths and weaknesses,” denvir said.in addition to calling relatives and experts on chechnya’s tortured history, lawyers have called witnesses to argue that the prison where tsarnaev would live out the rest of his life – the u.s. penitentiary administrative maximum facility in colorado – would be harsh and unforgiving.it is “a mechanism to cut off an inmate’s communications with the outside world,” defense witness mark bezy testified on wednesday.tsarnaev’s parents, anzor and zubeidat, were not called to testify. both now live in dagestan, the russian region bordering chechnya, and have not returned the united states since just after tsarnaev’s initial court appearance in 2013.russian hunger for newswith the tsarnaev family’s ties to russia and the north caucasus, there’s been intense interest in the trial for many russians, according to alexei venediktov, the editor-in-chief of ekho moskvy, an influential, independent radio station and web site in moscow.the proceedings, however, have received virtually no coverage in the russian news media, nearly all of which is state-controlled. venediktov told voa that’s probably because of growing concern from the kremlin about stability in the long-troubled north caucasus.“this process carries an unpleasant association, i think, for the leadership, in particular, of the russian federation, and therefore, i think, it’s possible there’s been embargo on news,” he said. he also said support is growing in russia to bring back the death penalty, and were the boston jury to sentence him to death, it would have a significant impact on the russian debate.“i think the jury’s verdict will be actively discussed in russia if it ends up being the death penalty,” he said.tlisova reported from boston; eckel reported from washington.

commander mark rowley characterized the arrests as “significant,” though he did not provide any details. he said nine people are currently in custody and one person has been released.police officials identified the attacker who killed four people near parliament as khalid masood, a briton who converted to islam and had a lengthy criminal record for weapons possession and other charges.rowley said masood’s birth name was adrian russell ajao and appealed to the public for any information about him.a woman holds up a sign at a vigil for the victims of wednesday's attack, at trafalgar square in london, march 23, 2017. the islamic state group has claimed responsibility for an attack by a man who plowed an suv into pedestrians and then stabbed a police officer.“we remain keen to hear from anyone who knew khalid masood well, understands who his associates were and can provide us with information about places he has recently visited,’’ rowley said. “there might be people out there who did have concerns about masood but did not feel comfortable for whatever reason in passing those concerns to us.’’islamic state said masood, who was 52, was a “soldier” of the extremist group who responded to its call to attack civilians and the military in countries allied with the united states in battling is.masood had never been convicted of terrorist offenses, but british security officials said he had been investigated in the past “in relation to concerns about violent extremism.” authorities say they believe he was acting alone wednesday when he ran down pedestrians on westminster bridge, a thames river crossing leading to the houses of parliament, crashed his rented vehicle into a gate and fatally stabbed a policeman who tried to stop him.armed police shot and killed masood moments later.a property in birmingham, england, was searched by police following wednesday's london attack, march 23, 2017.in the hours after wednesday’s attack in the heart of london, police conducted raids around the country in search of anyone who may have given support to masood. eight men and women were arrested thursday on suspicion of planning terrorist acts.the dead assailant, who was older than most islamist attackers involved in recent spectacular terror attacks in europe, had been a teacher of english and was known as a fanatical bodybuilder.one of the civilians who was run down on the bridge, a 75-year-old man, died thursday in a hospital, raising the casualty toll to four victims and masood.although islamic state claimed responsibility for the attack, a statement posted online did not implicate the group in the planning or execution of the attack.an italian tourist who witnessed the carnage told reporters he saw masood attack the policeman with two knives. “he gave [the officer] around 10 stabs in the back,” the visitor said.valiant efforts to resuscitate constable keith palmer at the scene failed. the 48-year-old officer was a 15-year police veteran.one american was among the dead - 54-year-old kurt cochran of utah, who was in london with his wife to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. his wife, melissa, was among the 30 people injured. masood’s vehicle hit the cochrans as they crossed westminster bridge.the remaining victim of the attack was a british school administrator, aysha frade, 43.candles burn on westminster bridge the day after an attack in london, march 23, 2017.mourners gathered in london’s trafalgar square thursday evening, about one kilometer from the crime scene, for a candlelight vigil. the mayor of london, sadiq khan, told the crowd of thousands that”those trying to destroy our shared way of life will never succeed.”khan said the vigil in the most recognizable public plaza in london was meant to honor the dead and injured, but also “to send a clear, clear message: londoners will never be cowed by terrorism.”rowley, head of counterterrorism efforts for london’s metropolitan police service, said the eight people arrested thursday were picked up during searches at six separate locations, and that investigations were continuing in london, birmingham and other parts of england. he declined to say whether or how those detained were involved in wednesday’s attack.“it is still our belief, which continues to be born out by our investigation, that this attacker acted alone and was inspired by international terrorism,” rowley told reporters.britain's prime minister theresa may gives a media statement outside 10 downing street in london, march 22, 2017, following a terror attack in the westminster area of london earlier wednesday.prime minister theresa may struck a defiant tone in discussing the attack before parliament thursday, telling british lawmakers that what london experienced was “an attack on free people everywhere.”“yesterday an act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy, but today we meet as normal, as generations have done before us and as future generations will continue to do, to deliver a simple message: we are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism,” she said.may thanked britain’s friends and allies around the world “who have made it clear that they stand with us at this time.”she said the victims include nationals of france, romania, south korea, germany, poland, ireland, china, italy and greece, as well

is yet another cruel act which will not be forgotten.a wanton attack on innocent men,women and childrenthe following statement was made by the secretary of state for northern ireland, mr. william whitelaw, in the house of commons, 24 july 1972:- as the house will know, the city and people of belfast suffered a murderous sequence of explosions last friday. most of the 27 explosions in belfast that day occurred within a 3½ hour period in the afternoon-at a time when, and at places where high civilian casualties must have been expected and intended. no adequate warnings were given. seven civilians and two soldiers were killed and at least 130 civilians injured-many gravely. i hardly need point out that all sections of the community are indiscriminately affected by these outrages. of the dead two were roman catholics. of the 130 injured at least 40 were roman catholics. 53 were men and boys, 77 women and children. i am sure the whole house will wish to join with me in expressing sympathy to the families of all those involved in this wanton attack on innocent men, women and children. after the appallingly bloodthirsty and criminal events of last friday, there cannot be any remaining shred of support for the men who perpetrate them. even those sectors of roman catholic opinion throughout the world which have traditionally identified themselves with and perhaps given the benefit of the doubt to any group of men who claimed to speak for the irish republican movement can surely no longer continue to uphold the men who were responsible for friday's horrible catalogue of slaughter. supporters of the republican movement in this country, in northern ireland, in the united states and elsewhere, will no doubt notice the revulsion in some circles in the irish republic. since parliament at the end of march entrusted the government with complete responsibility for all administration in northern ireland, we have made the most patient and reasoned effort to secure the end of violence. no one can deny that her majesty's government have now an absolutely unchallengeable right to ask this house, this country, and indeed the whole world for their support in an absolute determination to destroy the capacity of the ira for further acts of inhumanity. they have degraded the human race, and it must now be clear to all that their sole object is to promote their aims by violence and by violence alone.destruction in oxford street bus station where death came to six people and scores were injured. the station was crowded when the bomb exploded. it was the worst of the afternoon's 19 murderous bombings.destruction at smithfield bus station, scene of the first of the vicious series of attacks on innocent people. mercifully the buses here seen ablaze had not started filling up with passengers.destruction in york road railway terminus where the bomb was in an innocent-looking suitcase left on the platform.letters to the editor funeral with no shouted commandsbut only sobs of four small childrento-day (monday) i went to a funeral-that of one of \"bloody friday's\" victims. it wasn't one of those funerals we know so well in belfast, with the uniformed men, the ceremonial shots, the shouted commands, the graveside oration. the only uniforms were the black and white vestments of the clergy. the only arms were those of christ crucified on the cross which led the cortege. no shouted commands- only the sobbing of four small children. no graveside oration, only the tears in the eyes of a husband as final tribute. if there is power in the sobs of children and the tears of husbands and fathers, wives and mothers then the cause espoused by the terrorist is on the point of death: its followers now are but walking. dead, animated husks, soulless and mindless. rejected and disowned by any creature capable of pity and compassion. the earth which thudded on that coffin covered only a body, not the bestial deed which sent it there, an ever-pointing finger of condemnation to all involved - the terrorists who planned the bombing campaign, the terrorists who made the bombs, the terrorists who planted them: the politicians who wouldn't talk until all their demands were met and the politicians who talked too much and too often said the wrong thing; the leading churchmen, who merely mouthed pious attitudes. condemning violence in general but never aiming at specific deeds and organisations: the trade unionists who permitted discrimination to be the unwritten rule in our industrial life and the industrialists and businessmen who bowed to this evil on their premises; the neighbours, who were true neighbours and friends-until intimidation entered their street. to-day's victim had the dignity and honour of innocence and motherhood to take to her grave and maker, and leaves her legacy of a peace-loving, and in the course of time, happy family. her killers will face their maker with her blood and many others on their hands and can only leave a. their legacy hatred, sorrow and despair.a face in the crowd,belfast 13.destruction in botanic avenue after a bomb exploded in a hi-jacked bread van parked outside the york hotel. cars and houses suffered in the blast and there were the inevitable casualties.destruction at the busy antrim road-limeston road corner. the wreckage in the forefront is all that was left of the stolen van in which the bomb had been planted. women shoppers were among the casualties.destruction at the shopping centre on the cavehill road, where one of the last of the bombs killed three people, including a mother of seven and a boy of 14.reports 'streets swept by terror' \"such warnings as were given were so vague and imprecise as to be almost useless; for much of the afternoon belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic. girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets as plumes of smoke rose around them and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall. it was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe as each bomb exploded there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary but in fact were just as exposed as before. report in the guardian.'a day of horror and shame' friday, july 21, 1972, was a day of horror and shame in this stricken city. even hardened newsmen recoiled with shock from the scenes of carnage witnessed in belfast as firemen lifted the mangled bodies where bombs ripped through crowds of unsuspecting men, women and children at bus depots and other locations. in all my years of journalism, which included the worst days of the wartime blitzes, i have never seen scenes so horrible in this city and one felt a deep feeling of anger and shame that such deeds were planned and carried out by fellow irishmen. all ireland has been shamed by the events of this terrible july afternoon in belfast. report in the irish independent, dublin.'a deed of sick men' \"the chief injury is not to the british army, to the establishment or to big business but to the plain people of belfast and ireland. anyone who supports violence from any s i d e after yesterday's events is sick with the same affliction as those who did the deed. \"can anyone now believe that anything worth while can be established by these methods? that the country of anyone's vision can live with more memories of this kind?\" \"irish times\", dublin. 'the cold-blooded, co-ordinated bomb outrages are a shocking crime against an already innocent population who have already suffered too much. these were brutal murders which will be totally condemned by every decent person in the united kingdom.'mr. harold wilson, leader of the oppositionthe bombers strike - and this is some of the suffering they leftscenes of anguish in oxford street bus station where six people died - as pictured in the daily express \"a black sin ... that will never be erased\" by the editor of thesunday independentdublin these are dark days for ireland. we live in an age of cowardice, with the guilt spread evenly between the highest and the lowest in the land. we fostered the men who planned the murders of innocent men, women, boys and girls in belfast on friday. we fed these people with propaganda. we took advantage, when we could, of their exploits. and because we are not a morally courageous people, we never seriously tried to stop their terrible excesses. those among us who could have acted to halt the course of tragedy preferred to do nothing. those who could have spoken out, when words might have meant something, chose to hold their tongues. and the rest of us were content to let matters slide. now all of us must pay the price for this neglect. there is a black sin on the face of irish republicanism today that will never be erased. murder now lies at the feet of the irish nation and there is no gain-saying that fact. we cannot change past, however much we regret its record. but if we wish to restore the honour of our people, now is the time to act. we must break the paralysis that leaves the good name of the irish people in the hands of unscrupulous men. and we must find a way to make restitution for our failings. the gallantry of those who planted bombs in the middle of belfast's shopping areas on friday (and then ran like hell) will be sanctified by the almighty god of irish republicanism and reverently embalmed- in what we are pleased to call our national heritage. we won't have a ballad to commemorate the butchered fragments of a woman we saw on the telly being shovelled up by a fireman. who said dan breen is dead? his spirit is alive and well and looking forward to a cosy corner in whatever parliamentary system we are going to have for the next 50 years. is nobody going to shout stop!", "templates":

further clouded on wednesday by fresh allegations of ballot fraud.the opposition coalition called for mass protests “against the installation of the constituent fraud” to prevent the new assembly – made up entirely by the ruling socialist party and its political allies – from beginning its sessions on thursday.venezuela poll turnout figures ‘manipulated by at least 1m votes’ read moreas many as 40 countries have said they would not recognize the new assembly, which critics say is a thinly veiled attempt by nicolás maduro to consolidate power. the body will have the ability to dissolve state institutions and rewrite the constitution.maduro has said his aim is to bring peace to the sharply split country caught up in political crisis and economic meltdown.but the president and his closest allies have also vowed to use the assembly to jail key opposition leaders, remove the country’s outspoken chief prosecutor from her post and strip opposition legislators of their constitutional immunity.“the constituent assembly is the change so that this country can regain order. anarchy is over, here,” said cilia flores, maduro’s wife on receiving her accreditation as a member of the assembly. “justice will come starting tomorrow,” she said.new doubts were cast on the official turnout for the assembly vote, after the company that provides the technological platform for venezuela’s voting system said on wednesday that the government’s claim that more than 8 million people voted on sunday were wrong.“we know, without any doubt, that the turnout of the recent election for a national constituent assembly was manipulated,” antonio mugica, the chief executive of smartmatic, said in london.mugica said smartmatic detected the overstated turnout because of venezuela’s automated election system. “we estimate the difference between the actual participation and the one announced by authorities is at least 1m votes,” he said.the electoral council president, tibisay lucena, put the turnout at 41.53%, or 8,089,320 people. the opposition put the number at between 2 million and 3 million.only 3.7 million people had voted by 5.30pm in the constituent assembly election, according to internal electoral council data reviewed by reuters, casting doubt on the 8.1 million people authorities said had voted that day. voting lasted until 7pm.lucena dismissed mugica’s allegations, calling it an “opinion” of a company that played only a secondary role in the election and had no access to complete data. “a company located outside the country does not guarantee the transparency and credibility of the venezuelan electoral system,” she said.andrés izarra, a former information minister under maduro’s predecessor, hugo chávez, tweeted: “company which supports venezuelan electoral system confirms that election was manipulated by at least a million votes.”andrés izarra (@izarradeverdad) empresa que soporta sistema electoral vzlano confirma que elección fue manipulada en al menos un millón de votos https://t.co/6vn96sji97his tweet – a rare display of criticism from a veteran chavista – quickly went viral. in a follow-up tweet, izarra said he recognized there are “doubts that must be cleared up about the results of sunday’s election” but warned the opposition that he had not become one of them. “squallid ones, don’t count on me ever,” he tweeted.julio borges, the leader of the opposition-held parliament, said voter fraud was “the most serious crime that can be committed against democracy”.meanwhile international pressure mounted on maduro as his country and government became increasingly isolated, after two top political opponents under house arrest were dragged from their homes in midnight raids.the eu defied calls for sanctions against venezuela’s president after spanish prime minister mariano rajoy proposed the member countries block travel by anyone linked to maduro’s government. however, the bloc warned that it was ready to action if there was any further dilution of the country’s democratic institutions.federica mogherini, the eu’s high representative for foreign affairs, said in a statement that the union would not recognise the new constituent assembly due to “concerns over its effective representativeness and legitimacy”. she failed, however, to act on calls from the european parliament’s president, antonio tajani, for targeted sanctions against maduro.venezuela: maduro condemned after opposition duo arrested in midnight raids read more“the effective installation of the constituent assembly should be suspended and the attributions of all institutions foreseen by the constitution should be explicitly recognised,” she said.mogherini added a call for all parties to “negotiate a way forward”. she said: “the european union and its member states are ready to gradually step up their response in case democratic principles are further undermined and the venezuelan constitution is not respected.”on tuesday, the uk foreign office said all dependents of british embassy staff had been withdrawn from venezuela and recommended british citizens leave the warning that transport in and out

line of the race, killing 3 people and injuring several hundred others, including 17 who lost limbs.[1][7][8]three days later, the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) released images of two suspects,[9][10][11] who were later identified as chechen kyrgyzstani-american brothers dzhokhar tsarnaev and tamerlan tsarnaev.following the suspects' identification, they killed an mit policeman, kidnapped a man in his car, and had a shootout with the police in nearby watertown, during which two officers were severely injured (one of whom died a year later).tamerlan was shot several times, and his brother dzhokhar ran him over while escaping in the stolen car; tamerlan died soon after.an unprecedented manhunt for dzhokhar ensued on april 19, with thousands of law enforcement officers searching a 20-block area of watertown;[12] residents of watertown and surrounding communities were asked to stay indoors, and the transportation system and most businesses and public places closed.[13][14] around 6:00 p.m., a watertown resident discovered dzhokhar hiding in a boat in his backyard.[15] dzhokhar was shot and wounded by police before being taken into custody.[16]during questioning, dzhokhar said that he and his brother were motivated by the wars in iraq and afghanistan, that they were self-radicalized and unconnected to any outside terrorist groups, and that he was following his brother's lead.he said they learned to build explosive devices from the online magazine of al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula.[17] he also said they had intended to travel to new york city to bomb times square.on april 8, 2015, he was convicted of 30 charges, including use of a weapon of mass destruction and malicious destruction of property resulting in death.[2][18][19] two months later, he was sentenced to death,[20] though in july 2020 this sentence was vacated and is to be reheard by a new trial.[3]bombing [ edit ]the blasts (red) occurred along the marathon course (dark blue), the first nearer the finish line than the second.the 117th annual boston marathon was run on patriots' day, april 15, 2013.at 2:49 p.m. edt (18:49 utc), two bombs detonated about 210 yards (190 m) apart at the finish line on boylston street near copley square.[21][22][23][24] the first exploded outside marathon sports at 671–673 boylston street at 2:49:43 p.m.[21] at the time of the first explosion, the race clock at the finish line showed 04:09:43[25] – the elapsed time since the wave 3 start at 10:40 a.m.the second bomb exploded at 2:49:57 p.m.,[22][26] 14 seconds later and one block farther west at 755 boylston street.[8] the explosions took place nearly three hours after the winning runner crossed the finish line,[26] but with more than 5,700 runners yet to finish.[27]windows on adjacent buildings were blown out, but there was no structural damage.[26][28] runners continued to cross the line until 2:57 p.m.[29]casualties and initial response [ edit ]rescue workers and medical personnel, on hand as usual for the marathon, gave aid as additional police, fire, and medical units were dispatched,[30][31] including from surrounding cities as well as private ambulances from all over the state.the explosions killed 3 civilians and injured an estimated 264 others, who were treated at 27 local hospitals.at least 14 people required amputations, with some suffering traumatic amputations as a direct result of the blasts.[7]police, following emergency plans, diverted arriving runners to boston common and kenmore square.the nearby lenox hotel and other buildings were evacuated.[24] police closed a 15-block area around the blast site; this was reduced to a 12-block crime scene on april 16.[24][28][32] boston police commissioner edward f. davis recommended that people stay off the streets.[28]dropped bags and packages, abandoned as their owners fled from the blasts, increased uncertainty as to the possible presence of more bombs[21][33] and many false reports were received.[9][24][34][35][36][37][38] an unrelated electrical fire at the john f. kennedy presidential library in nearby dorchester was initially feared to be a bomb.emergency services at work after the bombingthe airspace over boston was restricted, and departures halted from boston's logan international airport.[39] some local transit service was halted as well.[26]the massachusetts emergency management agency suggested people trying to contact those in the vicinity use text messaging instead of voice calls because of crowded cellphone lines.[26] cellphone service in boston was congested but remained in operation, despite some local media reports stating that cell service was shut down to prevent cell phones from being used as detonators.[40]the american red cross helped concerned friends and family receive information about runners and casualties.[41][42] the boston police department also set up a helpline for people concerned about relatives or acquaintances to contact and a line for people to provide information.[43] google person finder activated their disaster service under boston marathon explosions to log known information about missing people as a publicly viewable file.[44]due to the closure of several hotels near the blast zone, a number of visitors were left with nowhere to stay; many boston-area residents opened their homes to them.[45]investigation [ edit ]this pressure cooker fragment was part of one of the explosive devices.the federal bureau of investigation led the investigation, assisted by the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, the central intelligence agency, the national counterterrorism center, and the drug enforcement administration.[46] it was initially believed by some that north korea was behind the attack after escalating tensions and threats with the u.s.[47][48]united states government officials stated that there had been no intelligence reports suggesting such an attack.representative peter king, a member of the house intelligence committee, said: \"i received two top secret briefings last week on the current threat levels in the united states, and there was

circuit board, and wiring.[51][53] a pressure cooker lid was found on a nearby rooftop.[54] both of the improvised explosive devices were pressure cooker bombs manufactured by the bombers.[55][56][57] authorities confirmed that the brothers used bomb-making instructions found in al qaeda in the arabian peninsula's inspire magazine.[58][59] after the suspects were identified, the boston globe reported that tamerlan purchased fireworks from a fireworks store in new hampshire.[60]on april 19, the fbi, west new york police department, and hudson county sheriff's department seized computer equipment from the apartment of the tsarnaevs' sister in west new york, new jersey.[61] on april 24, investigators reported that they had reconstructed the bombs, and believed that they had been triggered by remote controls used for toy cars.[62]april 18–19 shootings and manhunt [ edit ]release of suspect photos [ edit ]jeff bauman was immediately adjacent to one of the bombs and lost both legs; he wrote while in the hospital: \"bag, saw the guy, looked right at me\".[67] he later gave a detailed description of the suspects, which enabled images of them to be identified and circulated quickly.[67][68][69]at 5:20 p.m. on april 18, the fbi released images of two suspects carrying backpacks, asking the public's help in identifying them.[70][71] the fbi said that they were doing this in part to limit harm to people wrongly identified by news reports and on social-media.[72] as seen on video, the suspects stayed to observe the chaos after the explosions, then walked away casually.the public sent authorities a deluge of photographs and videos, which were scrutinized by both authorities and online public social networks.[71]mit shooting and carjacking [ edit ]scenes and approximate times of events of april 18–19a few hours after the photos were released, the tsarnaev brothers ambushed and shot sean a. collier of the massachusetts institute of technology police department six times[73] in an attempt to steal his smith & wesson m&p45 sidearm, which they could not free from his holster because of its retention system.[74] collier, aged 27, was seated in his police car near the building 32 on the massachusetts institute of technology campus.[16][75] he died soon after.[16][76]the brothers then carjacked a mercedes-benz m-class suv in the allston-brighton neighborhood of boston.tamerlan took the owner, chinese national dun \"danny\" meng[77] (chinese: 孟盾),[78] hostage and told him that he was responsible for the boston bombing and for killing a police officer.[16] dzhokhar followed them in their green honda civic, later joining them in the mercedes-benz.interrogation later revealed that the brothers \"decided spontaneously\" that they wanted to go to new york and bomb times square.[79]the tsarnaev brothers forced meng to use his atm cards to obtain $800 in cash.[80][81] they transferred objects to the mercedes-benz and one brother followed it in their civic,[82] for which an all-points bulletin was issued.while the tsarnaev brothers stopped at a shell gas station, meng escaped and ran across the street to the mobil gas station, asking the clerk to call 911.[83][84] his cell phone remained in the vehicle, allowing the police to focus their search on watertown.[85]watertown shootout [ edit ]shortly after midnight on april 19, watertown police officer joseph reynolds identified the brothers in the honda and the stolen mercedes after overhearing radio traffic that the vehicle was \"pinged\" by cambridge officers on dexter ave. in watertown.reynolds followed the vehicle while waiting for additional units to perform a high-risk traffic stop when the suspect vehicles both turned onto laurel st. and stopped.tamerlan tsarnaev stepped out of his vehicle and immediately opened fire on officer reynolds and sergeant john maclellan, who both returned fire and requested emergency assistance over their radios.a violent gun battle ensued between tsarnaev, the aforementioned officers, and subsequent additional police responding to the \"shots fired\" radio transmissions from reynolds and maclellan in the 100 block of laurel st.[16][86][87] an estimated 200 to 300 rounds of ammunition were fired, 56 of which were later determined to have been fired from the suspects, and at least one pressure cooker bomb and several \"crude grenades\" were thrown.[87][88]the agencies involved in the nearly 7-minute long shootout included the watertown police department, cambridge police department, boston police department, massachusetts state police (msp), boston university police department, and mbta transit police department.the majority of the officers involved in the shootout were equipped by their respective agencies with either the glock 22 or glock 23 .40 s&w-caliber pistols.msp troopers were armed with smith & wesson m&p45 pistols chambered in .45 acp; this lead investigators to match the 9mm casings and projectiles found at the scene to be matched to the suspects' 9mm ruger p95 pistol.according to watertown police chief edward deveau, the brothers had an \"arsenal of guns.\"[89] tamerlan eventually ran out of ammunition and threw his empty ruger pistol at watertown pd sergeant jeffrey pugliese, who subsequently tackled him with assistance from sergeant maclellan.[90][91]tamerlan's younger brother dzhokhar then drove the stolen suv toward tamerlan and the police, who unsuccessfully tried to drag tamerlan out of his path;[90][91] the car ran over tamerlan and dragged him a short distance down the street, narrowly missing the watertown officers.[16][90][92][93] dzhokhar abandoned the car half a mile away and fled on foot.[16][85][94][95] badly wounded, tamerlan tsarnaev was taken into custody, and died at 1:35 a.m. at beth israel deaconess medical center.[96]massachusetts bay transportation authority police officer richard h. donohue jr.[97] was critically wounded[98] in crossfire from other officers shooting at the fleeing vehicle, but survived.[99] boston police department officer dennis simmonds was injured by a hand grenade and died on april 10, 2014.[66] fifteen other officers were also injured.[86] a later report by harvard kennedy school's program on crisis leadership concluded that lack of coordination among police agencies had put the public at excessive risk during the shootout.[100]only one firearm was recovered at the scene, tsarnaev's ruger p95, which was found to have a defaced serial number.[101][102]identification and search for suspects [ edit ]records on the honda left at the scene identified the men[103] as two brothers whose family had immigrated to the united states seeking political asylum around 2002: 26-year-old tamerlan tsarnaev and 19-year-old dzhokhar \"jahar\" tsarnaev.[104][105] the fbi released additional photos of the two during the watertown incident.[106] early on april 19, watertown residents received automated calls asking them to stay indoors.[107] that same morning governor patrick asked residents of watertown and adjacent cities and towns[108][109][110] to \"shelter in place\".[111] somerville residents also received automated calls instructing them to shelter in place.[112]a 20-block area of watertown was cordoned off and residents were told not to leave their homes or answer the door, as officers scoured the area in tactical gear.helicopters circled the area and swat teams in armored vehicles moved through in formation, with officers going door to door.[113] on the scene were the fbi, the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, diplomatic security service, hsi-ice, the national guard, the boston, cambridge, watertown police departments, and the massachusetts state police.the show of force was the first major field test of the interagency task forces created in the wake of the september 11 attacks.[114]the entire public transit network and most boston taxi services[a] were suspended, as was amtrak service to and from boston.[75][116] logan international airport remained open under heightened security.[116] universities, schools, many businesses, and other facilities were closed as thousands of law enforcement personnel participated in the door-to-door manhunt in watertown.others followed up on other leads, including searching the house that the brothers shared in cambridge, where seven improvised explosive devices were found.[117]the brothers' father spoke from his home in makhachkala, dagestan, encouraging dzhokhar to: \"give up.you have a bright future ahead of you.come home to russia.\"he continued, \"if they killed him, then all hell would break loose.\"[118] on television, dzhokhar's uncle from montgomery village, maryland pleaded with him to turn himself in.[119]on the evening of april 19, two hours after the shelter-in-place order had been lifted, david henneberry, a watertown resident outside the search area, noticed that the tarp was loose on his parked boat.[120][121] investigating, he saw a body lying inside the boat in a pool of blood.[122] he contacted the authorities, who surrounded the boat.a police helicopter verified movement through a thermal imaging device.[86][123] the figure inside started poking at the tarp, promoting police to shoot at the boat.[124]according to boston police commissioner ed davis and watertown police chief deveau, dzhokhar tsarnaev was shooting at police from inside the boat, \"exchanging fire for an hour\".[125] a subsequent report indicated that the firing lasted for a shorter time.[126] despite this, the suspect was found to have no weapon when he was captured.[127]dzhokhar tsarnaev was arrested at 8:42 p.m.[128][129] and taken to beth israel deaconess medical center, where he was listed in critical condition[130] with gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs, and hand.[131] initial reports that the neck wound represented a suicide attempt were contradicted by him being unarmed.[132] the situation was chaotic, according to a police source quoted by the washington post, and the firing of weapons occurred during \"the fog of war\".[126] a subsequent review by the commonwealth of massachusetts provided this more specific summary: \"one officer fired his weapon without appropriate authority in response to perceived movement in the boat, and surrounding officers followed suit in a round of 'contagious fire', assuming they were being fired on by the suspect.weapons continued to be fired for several seconds until on scene supervisors ordered a ceasefire and regained control of the scene.the unauthorized shots created another dangerous crossfire situation\".[133]these confusions were caused in part by a lack of clearly identified and coordinated law enforcement command of the thousands of officers from surrounding communities who self-deployed into the watertown area during the events.[134]legal proceedings [ edit ]interrogation [ edit ]united states senators kelly ayotte, saxby chambliss, lindsey graham, and john mccain, and representative peter t. king suggested that dzhokhar tsarnaev, a u.s. citizen, should be tried as an unlawful enemy combatant rather than as a criminal, potentially preventing him from obtaining legal counsel.[135][136] others said that doing so would be illegal, including prominent american legal scholar and lawyer alan dershowitz, and would jeopardize the prosecution.[137][138] the government decided to try dzhokhar in the federal criminal court system and not as an enemy combatant.[139]dzhokhar was questioned for 16 hours by investigators but stopped communicating with them on the night of april 22 after judge marianne bowler read him a miranda warning.[79][140] dzhokhar had not previously been given a miranda warning, as federal law enforcement officials invoked the warning's public safety exception.[141] this raised doubts whether his statements during this investigation would be admissible as evidence and led to a debate surrounding miranda rights.[142][143][144]charges and detention [ edit ]dzhokhar tsarnaev in a court holding cell on july 10, 2013on april 22, 2013, formal criminal charges were brought against tsarnaev in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts during a bedside hearing while he was hospitalized.he was charged with use of a weapon of mass destruction and with malicious destruction of property resulting in death.[2] some of the charges carry potential sentences of life imprisonment or the death penalty.[145] tsarnaev was judged to be awake, mentally competent, and lucid, and he responded to most questions by nodding.the judge asked him whether he was able to afford an attorney and he said no; he was represented by the federal public defender's office.[146] on april 26, dzhohkar tsarnaev was moved from beth israel deaconess medical center to the federal medical center at fort devens, about 40 miles (64 km) from boston.fmc devens is a federal prison medical facility at a former army base[147] where he was held in solitary confinement at a segregated housing unit[148] with 23-hour-per-day lockdown.[149][150]on july 10, 2013, tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to 30 charges in his first public court appearance, including a murder charge for mit police officer sean collier.[151] he was back in court for a status hearing on september 23,[152] and his lawyers requested more time to prepare their defense.[153] on october 2, tsarnaev's attorneys asked the court to lift the special administrative measures (sams) imposed by attorney general holder in august, saying that the measures had left tsarnaev unduly isolated from communication with his family and lawyers, and that no evidence suggested that he posed a future threat.[154]trial and sentencing [ edit ]jury selection began on january 5, 2015, and was completed on march 3, with a jury consisting of eight men and ten women (including six alternates).[155] the trial began on march 4 with assistant u.s. attorney william weinreb describing the bombing and painting dzhokhar as \"a soldier in a holy war against americans\" whose motive was \"reaching paradise\".he called the brothers equal participants.[156]defense attorney judy clarke admitted that dzhokhar tsarnaev had placed the second bomb and was present at the murder of sean collier, the carjacking of dun meng, and the watertown shootout, but she emphasized the influence that his older brother had on him, portraying him as a follower.[157] between march 4 and 30, prosecutors called more than 90 witnesses, including bombing survivors who described losing limbs in the attack, and the government rested its case on march 30.[158] the defense rested as well on march 31, after calling four witnesses.[159]tsarnaev was found guilty on all 30 counts on april 8.[160] the sentencing phase of the trial began on april 21,[161] and a further verdict was reached on may 15 in which it was recommended that he be put to death.[162] tsarnaev was sentenced to death on june 24, after apologizing to the victims.[163] in 2018 tsarnaev's lawyers appealed on the grounds that a lower-court judge's refusal to move the case to another city not traumatized by the bombings deprived him of a fair trial.[164]on july 30, 2020, tsarnaev's death sentence was reversed by the united states court of appeals for the first circuit, which found that the district court did not properly screen jurors on how much they had heard of the case during jury selection.the first circuit vacated the death sentence and three of the other thirty convictions against tsarnaev, and ordered a new penalty phase jury trial with fresh jurors, leaving the decision of a new change of venue to the district court.tsarnaev's remaining convictions still carried multiple life sentences, assuring that he would remain in prison regardless of the results of the new trial.[3]motives and backgrounds of the tsarnaev brothers [ edit ]motives [ edit ]according to fbi interrogators, dzhokhar and his brother were motivated by islamic beliefs but \"were not connected to any known terrorist groups\", instead learning to build explosive weapons from an online magazine published by al-qaeda affiliates in yemen.[17] they further alleged that \"dzhokhar and his brother considered suicide attacks and striking [the boston pops fireworks spectacular] on the fourth of july\";[165] but ultimately decided to use remotely-activated pressure cooker bombs and other ieds.fox news reported that the brothers \"chose the prestigious race as a 'target of opportunity' ... [after] the building of the bombs came together more quickly than expected\".[166][167]dzhokhar said that he and his brother wanted to defend islam from the u.s., accusing the u.s. of conducting the iraq war and war in afghanistan against muslims.[139][168][169] a cbs report revealed that dzhokhar had scrawled a note with a marker on the interior wall of the boat where he was hiding; the note stated that the bombings were \"retribution for u.s. military action in afghanistan and iraq\", and called the boston victims \"collateral damage\", \"in the same way innocent victims have been collateral damage in u.s. wars around the world.\"[5][6] photographs of the note were later used in the trial.[170][171]some political science and public policy writers suggest that islam may have played a secondary role in the attacks.[172] these writers theorize that the primary motives might have been sympathy towards the political aspirations in the caucasus region and tamerlan's inability to become fully integrated into american society.[172] according to the los angeles times, a law enforcement official said that dzhokhar \"did not seem as bothered about america's role in the muslim world\" as his brother tamerlan had been.[59] dzhokhar identified tamerlan as the \"driving force\" behind the bombing, and said that his brother had only recently recruited him to help.[139][173]some journalists and dzhokhar tsarnaev's defense attorney have suggested that the fbi may have recruited or attempted to recruit tamerlan tsarnaev as an informant.[174][175][176][177]backgrounds [ edit ]tamerlan tsarnaev was born in 1986 in the kalmyk autonomous soviet socialist republic, north caucasus.[178] dzhokhar was born in 1993 in kazakhstan, although some reports say that his family claims that he was born in dagestan.[179] the family spent time in almaty, kazakhstan, and in makhachkala, dagestan.[81][180] they are half chechen through their father anzor, and half avar[181] through their mother zubeidat.they never lived in chechnya, yet the brothers identified themselves as chechen.[179][182][183][184]the tsarnaev family immigrated to the united states in 2002[16][182][185][186] where they applied for political asylum, settling in cambridge, massachusetts.[105] tamerlan tsarnaev attended bunker hill community college but dropped out to become a boxer.his goal was to gain a place on the u.s. olympic boxing team, saying that, \"unless his native chechnya becomes independent\", he would \"rather compete for the united states than for russia\".[188] he married u.s. citizen katherine russell on july 15, 2010, in the masjid al quran mosque.while initially quoted in a student magazine as saying, \"i don't have a single american friend.i don't understand them,\" a later fbi interview report documents tamerlan stating it was a misquote, and that most of his friends were american.[189][190] he had a history of violence, including an arrest in july 2009 for assaulting his girlfriend.[191]the brothers were muslim; tamerlan's aunt stated that he had recently become a devout muslim.[183][184] tamerlan became more devout and religious after 2009,[192][193] and a youtube channel in his name linked to salafist[192] and islamist[194][195] videos.the fbi was informed by the russian federal security service (fsb) in 2011 that he was a \"follower of radical islam.\"[194] in response, the fbi interviewed tamerlan and his family and searched databases, but they did not find any evidence of \"terrorism activity, domestic or foreign.\"[196][197][198][199][200][201] during the 2012 trip to dagestan, tamerlan was reportedly a frequent visitor at a mosque on kotrova street in makhachkala,[202][203][204] believed by the fsb to be linked with radical islam.[203] some believe that \"they were motivated by their faith, apparently an anti-american, radical version of islam\" acquired in the u.s.,[205] while others believe that the turn happened in dagestan.[206]at the time of the bombing, dzhokhar tsarnaev was a student at the university of massachusetts dartmouth with a major in marine biology.[207] he became a naturalized u.s. citizen on september 11, 2012.[208] tamerlan's boxing coach reported to nbc that the young brother was greatly affected by tamerlan and admired him.[209][210]tamerlan was previously connected to the triple homicide in waltham, massachusetts, on the evening of september 11, 2011, but he was not a suspect at the time.[211][212] brendan mess, erik weissman, and raphael teken were murdered in mess's apartment.all had their throats slit from ear to ear with such great force that they were nearly decapitated.the local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other, and that the murders were not random.[213] tamerlan tsarnaev had previously described murder victim brendan mess as his \"best friend.\"[214] after the bombing and subsequent revelations of tsarnaev's personal life, the waltham murders case was reexamined in april 2013 with tsarnaev as a new suspect.[211] both abc and the new york times have reported that there is strong evidence which implicates tsarnaev in this triple homicide.[214][215]some analysts claim that the tsarnaev's mother zubeidat tsarnaeva is a radical extremist and supporter of jihad who influenced her sons' behavior.[216][217] this prompted the russian government to warn the u.s. government on two occasions about the family's behavior.both tamerlan and his mother were placed on a terrorism watch list about 18 months before the bombing took place.[218]other arrests, detentions, and prosecutions [ edit ]people detained and released [ edit ]on april 15, several people who were near the scene of the blast were taken into custody and questioned about the bombing, including a saudi man whom police stopped as he was walking away from the explosion; they detained him when some of his responses made them uncomfortable.[219][220][221][222] law enforcement searched his residence in a boston suburb, and the man was found to have no connection to the attack.an unnamed u.s. official said, \"he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.\"[35][223][224]on the night of april 18, two men who were riding in a taxi in the vicinity of the shootout were arrested and released shortly thereafter when police determined that they were not involved in the marathon attacks.[225] another man was arrested several blocks from the site of the shootout and was forced to strip naked by police who feared that he might have concealed explosives.he was released that evening after a brief investigation determined that he was an innocent bystander.[226][227]ibragim todashev [ edit ]on may 22, the fbi interrogated ibragim todashev in orlando, florida, who was a chechen from boston.during the interrogation, he was shot and killed by an fbi agent who claimed that todashev attacked him.[228] the new york times quoted an unnamed law enforcement official as saying that todashev had confessed to a triple homicide, and had implicated tsarnaev as well.[229] todashev's father claimed his son is innocent and that federal investigators are biased against chechens and made up their case against him.[230]dias kadyrbayev, azamat tazhayakov, and robel phillipos [ edit ]personal backgrounds [ edit ]robel phillipos (19) was a u.s. citizen of ethiopian descent living in cambridge who was arrested and faced with charges of knowingly making false statements to police.[231][232] he graduated from high school in 2011 with dzhokhar tsarnaev.[233] dias kadyrbayev (19) and azamat tazhayakov (20) were natives of kazakhstan living in the u.s.[234][235] they were dzhokhar tsarnaev's roommates in an off-campus housing complex in new bedford, massachusetts, at which tsarnaev had sometimes stayed.[231]phillipos, kadyrbayev, tazhayakov, and tsarnaev entered the university of massachusetts dartmouth in the fall of 2011 and knew each other well.after seeing photos of tsarnaev on television, the three men traveled to his dorm room where they retrieved a backpack and laptop belonging to tsarnaev.the backpack was discarded, but police recovered it and its contents in a nearby new bedford landfill on april 26.during interviews, the men initially denied visiting the dorm room but later admitted their actions.[231][236]arrests and legal proceedings [ edit ]kadyrbayev and tazhayakov were arrested by police at the off-campus housing complex during the night of april 18–19.an unidentified girlfriend of one of the men was also arrested,[234][235] but all three were soon released.[231]kadyrbayev and tazhayakov were re-arrested in new bedford on april 20 and held on immigration-related violations.they appeared before a federal immigration judge on may 1 and were charged with overstaying their student visas.[237][238][239] that same day, kadyrbayev and tazhayakov were charged criminally with:willfully conspir(ing) with each other to commit an offense against the united states… by knowingly destroying, concealing, and covering up objects belonging to dzhokhar tsarnaev, namely, a backpack containing fireworks and a laptop computer, with the intent to impede, obstruct, and influence the criminal investigation of the marathon bombing.[240][241]kadyrbayev and tazhayakov were indicted by a federal grand jury on august 8, 2013, on charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice for helping dzhokhar tsarnaev dispose of a laptop computer, fireworks, and a backpack after the bombing.each faced up to 25 years in prison and deportation if convicted.[242] tazhayakov was convicted of obstruction of justice and conspiracy on july 21, 2014.[243]kadyrbayev pleaded guilty to obstruction charges on august 22, 2014,[244] but sentencing was delayed pending the u.s. supreme court's ruling in yates v. united states.[245] kadyrbayev was sentenced to six years in prison in june 2015.[246] he was deported back to kazakhstan in october 2018.[247]tazhayakov pleaded not guilty and went to trial, arguing that \"kadyrbayev was the mastermind behind destroying the evidence and that tazhayakov only 'attempted obstruction.'\"jurors returned a guilty verdict against him, however, and he was sentenced to 42 months in prison in june 2015, which equated to three and a half years.judge douglas woodlock gave a lighter sentence to tazahayakov than to kadyrbayev, who was viewed as more culpable.[246] tazhayakov was released in may 2016 and subsequently deported.[248]phillipos was arrested and faced charges of knowingly making false statements to police.[231][232] he was released on $100,000 bail and placed under house confinement with an ankle monitor.[233] he was convicted on october 28, 2014, on two charges of lying about being in tsarnaev's dorm room.he later acknowledged that he had been in the room while two friends removed a backpack containing potential evidence relating to the bombing.[249]phillipos faced a maximum sentence of eight years' imprisonment on each count.[250] in june 2015, u.s. district judge douglas p. woodlock sentenced him to three years in prison.[251] phillipos filed an appeal, but his sentence was upheld in court on february 28, 2017.[252]phillipos was released from prison in philadelphia on february 26, 2018, and must serve a three year probation upon his release.[253]khairullozhon matanov [ edit ]a federal indictment was unsealed against khairullozhon matanov on may 30, 2014, charging him with \"one count of destroying, altering, and falsifying records, documents, and tangible objects in a federal investigation, specifically information on his computer, and three counts of making materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements in a federal terrorism investigation.\"matanov bought dinner for the two tsarnaev brothers 40 minutes after the bombing.after the tsarnaev brothers' photos were released to the public, matanov viewed the photos on the cnn and fbi websites before attempting to reach dzhokhar, and then tried to give away his cell phone and delete hundreds of documents from his computer.prosecutors said that matanov attempted to mislead investigators about the nature of his relationship with the brothers and to conceal that he shared their philosophy of violence.[254][255]matanov was originally from kyrgyzstan.he came to the u.s. in 2010 on a student visa, and later claimed asylum.he attended quincy college for two years before dropping out to become a taxicab driver.he was living in quincy, massachusetts, at the time of his arrest, and was a friend of tamerlan tsarnaev.[255]in march 2015, matanov pleaded guilty to all four counts.[255][256] in june 2015, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison.[255]victims [ edit ]deaths [ edit ]three people were killed in the bombing.krystle marie campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager from medford, massachusetts, was killed by the first bomb.[257] lü lingzi, (chinese: 吕令子)[258][259] a 23-year-old chinese national and boston university statistics graduate student from shenyang, liaoning,[260][261][262][263] and 8-year old martin william richard from the dorchester neighborhood of boston, were killed by the second bomb.[264][265]sean a. collier, 27 years old, was ambushed by the bombers as he sat in his police car on april 18, at about 10:48 p.m.he was an mit police officer, and had been with the somerville auxiliary police department from 2006 to 2009.[266] he died from multiple gunshot wounds.[267]boston police department officer dennis simmonds died on april 10, 2014, from hand-grenade injuries received during the watertown shootout a year before.[66]injuries [ edit ]according to the boston public health commission, 264 civilians were treated at 27 local hospitals.[7][268] eleven days later, 29 remained hospitalized, one in critical condition.[269] many victims had lower leg injuries and shrapnel wounds,[270] which indicated that the devices were low to the ground.[271] at least 16 civilians lost limbs, at the scene or by surgical amputation, and three lost more than one limb.[272][273][274][275]doctors described removing \"ball-bearing type\" metallic beads a little larger than bbs and small carpenter-type nails about 0.5 to 1 inch (1 to 3 cm) long.[276] similar objects were found at the scene.[51] the new york times cited doctors as saying that the bombs mainly injured legs, ankles, and feet because they were low to the ground, instead of fatally injuring abdomens, chests, shoulders, and heads.[277] some victims had perforated eardrums.[271]mbta police officer richard h. donohue jr. (33) was critically wounded during a firefight with the bombers just after midnight on april 19.[97] he lost almost all of his blood, and his heart stopped for 45 minutes, during which time he was

received severe burns and shrapnel wounds.he was the last victim released from hospital care on july 24, 2013.[278]reactions [ edit ]law enforcement, local and national politicians, and various heads of state reacted quickly to the bombing, generally condemning the act and expressing sympathies for the victims.[52][279]aid to victims [ edit ]the prudential tower lit up with a large \"1\" for the one fund boston a week after the bombingthe one fund boston was established by massachusetts governor deval patrick and boston mayor thomas menino to make monetary distributions to bombing victims.[280][281] the boston strong concert at the td garden in boston on may 30, 2013, benefitted the one fund, which ultimately received more than $69.8 million in donations.[282] a week after the bombing, crowd funding websites[283] received more than 23,000 pledges promising more than $2 million for the victims, their families, and others affected by the bombing.[284] the israel trauma coalition for response and preparedness sent six psychologists and specialists from israel to help boston emergency responders, government administrators, and community people develop post-terrorist attack recovery strategies.[285]local reaction [ edit ]the boston red sox wore this patch on their uniforms in memory of the victims.victims of the bombing are remembered at copley square in boston.[286] a monument memorializing the victims of the bombing was installed on boylston street, at the location of the explosions, in 2019.numerous sporting events, concerts, and other public entertainment were postponed or cancelled in the days following the bombing.[287][287][288][289][290] the mbta public transit system was under heavy national guard and police presence and it was shut down a second time april 19 during the manhunt.[75][116][291]in the days after the bombing, makeshift memorials began to spring up along the cordoned-off area surrounding boylston street.the largest was located on arlington street, the easternmost edge of the barricades, starting with flowers, tokens, and t-shirts.[292][293][294][295][296] in june, the makeshift memorial located in copley square was taken down and the memorial objects located there were moved to the archives in west roxbury for cleaning, fumigation, and archiving.[297]five years after the bombing, the boston globe reported all of the items from the memorials were being housed in a climate controlled environment, free of charge, by the storage company, iron mountain in northborough, massachusetts.some of the items are also being stored in boston's city archives in west roxbury.[298]boston university established a scholarship in honor of lü lingzi, a student who died in the bombing.[299] university of massachusetts boston did the same in honor of alumna and bombing victim krystle campell.[300] mit also established a scholarship and erected a sculpture (unveiled on april 29, 2015), both in memory of mit police officer sean collier.one study conducted by the institute for public service at suffolk university in boston, massachusetts, records the mental health and emotional response of various survivors, for three years following the bombing.in doing so, it reviews the kinds of aid that were available in local hospitals and gives advice as to how a person or community may be healed.[301]this study also mentions that after realizing the under coverage of people in the city being killed or injured on a daily basis, the city of boston \"applied for and received a grant from the rockefeller foundation to be part of their 100 resilient cities network and to develop a cross cutting resilience strategy\".however, there was rising anti-muslim sentiment online and locally in the weeks following the bombing, causing distress in the local muslim community and leaving some afraid of going out.[302]a monument memorializing the victims was completed at the bombing site on august 19, 2019.[286]national reaction [ edit ]president barack obama addressed the nation after the attack.[303] he said that the perpetrators were still unknown, but that the government would \"get to the bottom of this\" and that those responsible \"will feel the full weight of justice\".[304] he ordered flags to half-staff until april 20 on all federal buildings as \"a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on april 15, 2013 in boston, massachusetts.\"[305]moments of silence were held at various events across the country, including at the openings of the new york stock exchange, nasdaq, and nymex on the day after the bombing.[306] numerous special events were held, including marathons and other runs.[307][308][309][310]international reactions [ edit ]flag flying at half staff at the american consulate in milan , italythe bombing was denounced and condolences were offered by many international leaders as well as leading figures from international sport.security measures were increased worldwide in the wake of the attack.[311][312][313][314]in china, users posted condolence messages on weibo in response to the death of lü lingzi.[315] chris buckley of the new york times said \"ms. lu's death gave a melancholy face to the attraction that america and its colleges exert over many young chinese.\"[261] laurie burkitt of the wall street journal said \"ms. lu's death resonates with many in china\" due to the one-child policy.[316]organizers of the london marathon, which was held six days after the boston bombing, reviewed security arrangements for their event.hundreds of extra police officers were drafted in to provide a greater presence on the streets, and a record 700,000 spectators lined the streets.runners in london observed a 30-second silence in respect for the victims of boston shortly before the race began, and many runners wore black ribbons on their vests.organizers also pledged to donate us$3 to a fund for boston marathon victims for every person who finished the race.[317][318][319]organizers of the 2013 vancouver sun run, which was held on april 21, 2013, donated $10 from every late entry for the race to help victims of the bombing at the boston marathon.jamie pitblado, vice-president of promotions for the vancouver sun and the province, said the money would go to one fund boston, an official charity that collected donations for the victims and their families.sun run organizers raised anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000.there were over 48,000 participants, many dressed in blue and yellow (boston colors) with others wearing boston red sox caps.[320]petr gandalovic, ambassador of the czech republic, released a statement after noticing much confusion on facebook and twitter between his nation and the chechen republic.\"the czech republic and chechnya are two very different entities – the czech republic is a central european country; chechnya is a part of the russian federation.\"[321]security was also stepped up in singapore in response to online threats made on attacking several locations in the city-state and the singapore marathon in december.two suspects were investigated and one was eventually arrested for making false bomb threats.[322]russian reaction [ edit ]the russian government said that special attention would be paid to security at upcoming international sports events in russia, including the 2014 winter olympics.[323] according to the russian embassy in the u.s., president vladimir putin condemned the bombing as a \"barbaric crime\" and \"stressed that the russian federation will be ready, if necessary, to assist in the u.s. authorities' investigation.\"[324] he urged closer cooperation of security services with western partners[325] but other russian authorities and mass media blamed the u.s. authorities for negligence as they warned the u.s. of the tsarnaevs.[326] moreover russian authorities and mass media since the spring of 2014 blame the united states for politically motivated false information about the lack of response from russian authorities after subsequent u.s.requests.[citation needed] as proof a letter from the russian federal security service (fsb) was shown to the members of an official u.s. congressional delegation to moscow during their visit.this letter with information about tsarnaev (including his biography details, connections and phone number) had been sent from the fsb to the fbi and cia during march 2011.[327]republican u.s.senators saxby chambliss and richard burr reported that russian authorities had separately asked both the fbi (at least twice: during march and november 2011) and the cia (september 2011) to look carefully into tamerlan tsarnaev and provide more information about him back to russia.[328] russian federal security service (fsb) secretly recorded phone conversations between tamerlan tsarnaev and his mother (they vaguely and indirectly discussed jihad) and sent these to the fbi as evidence of possible extremist links within the family.[citation needed] however, while russia offered us intelligence services warnings that tsarnaev planned to link up with extremist groups abroad, an fbi investigation yielded no evidence to support those claims at the time.in addition, subsequent u.s. requests for additional information about tsarnaev went unanswered by the russians.[329]chechen reactions [ edit ]on april 19, 2013, the press-secretary of the head of the chechen republic, ramzan kadyrov, issued a statement that, inter alia, read: \"the boston bombing suspects have nothing to do with chechnya\".[330][331] on the same day, kadyrov was reported by the guardian to have written on instagram:[332]any attempt to make a link between chechnya and the tsarnaevs, if they are guilty, is in vain.they grew up in the u.s., their views and beliefs were formed there.the roots of evil must be searched for in america.the whole world must battle with terrorism.we know this better than anyone.we wish recover [sic] to all the victims and share americans' feeling of sorrow.akhmed zakayev, head of the secular wing of the chechen separatist movement, now in exile in london, condemned the bombing as \"terrorist\" and expressed condolences to the families of the victims.zakayev denied that the bombers were in any way representative of the chechen people, saying that \"the chechen people never had and can not have any hostile feelings toward the united states and its citizens.\"[333]the mujahideen of the caucasus emirate province of dagestan, the caucasian islamist organization in both chechnya and dagestan, denied any link to the bombing or the tsarnaev brothers and stated that it was at war with russia, not the united states.it also said that it had sworn off violence against civilians since 2012.[334][335][336]criticism of the \"shelter-in-place\" directive and house-to-house searches [ edit ]during the manhunt for the perpetrators of the bombing, governor deval patrick said \"we are asking people to shelter in place.\"the request was highly effective; most people stayed home, causing boston, watertown, and cambridge to come to a virtual standstill.according to time magazine, \"media described residents complying with a 'lockdown order,' but in reality the governor's security measure was a request.\"scott silliman, emeritus director of the center on law, ethics and national security at duke law school, said that the shelter-in-place request was voluntary.[337]the shelter-in-place directive was criticized by some commentators.michael cohen of the observer said that americans have little experience with daily terrorism compared to some countries and \"are more primed to … assume the absolute worst.\"[338] cohen wrote that it was not the first time dangerous murderers have been on the loose in a large american city (citing christopher dorner in 2013 and the beltway sniper attacks in 2002), but noted that \"lockdown\" measures were not used in those cases.[338] former congressman and presidential candidate ron paul, criticized what he described as a \"military-style takeover of parts of boston\" during the investigation and wrote that \"this unprecedented move should frighten us as much or more than the attack itself.\"[339]haaretz's chemi salev wrote that \"in terms of cost-benefit analysis, from the evil terrorist's point of view, the boylston street bombings and their aftermath can only be viewed as a resounding triumph\" since the \"relatively amateurish\" terrorists managed to intimidate a vast number of people and got a maximum amount of publicity.[340] responding to salev in the new york times, ross douthat commented that the massive manhunt operation might deter other amateur terrorists, but not hard-core terrorists such as mohammed atta.[341] douthat argued that out-of-the-ordinary measures can only be used when terrorism itself is out-of-the-ordinary: if attacks started to occur more often, people would not be as willing to comply with shelter-in-place commands, yet once a terrorist has been hunted with such an operation, it is hard to justify why such measures should not be taken the next time.[341]the national lawyers guild and some news outlets questioned the constitutionality of the door-to-door searches conducted by law enforcement officers looking for dzhokhar tsarnaev.[342][343][344]one boston day [ edit ]on the second anniversary of the boston marathon bombings, mayor marty walsh established april 15, the day of the bombings, as an official and permanent holiday called \"one boston day\", dedicated to conducting random acts of kindness and helping others out.[345] over the past four years, some examples of acts of kindness being done have been donating blood to the american red cross, donating food to the greater boston food bank, opening free admission in places like the museum of science and museum of fine arts, donating shoes to homeless shelters, and donating to military and veteran charities.[346][347]conflicting reports [ edit ]on the afternoon of the bombing, the new york post reported that a suspect, a saudi arabian male, was under guard and being questioned at a boston hospital.[348] that evening, boston police commissioner ed davis said that there had not been an arrest.[349] the post did not retract its story about the suspect, leading to widespread reports by cbs news, cnn, and other media that a middle eastern suspect was in custody.[350] the day after the bombing, a majority of outlets were reporting that the saudi was a witness, not a suspect.[351]the new york post on its april 18 front page showed two men, and said they were being sought by the authorities.the two were not the ones being sought as suspects.they were a 17-year-old boy and his track coach.the boy, from revere, massachusetts, turned himself over to the police immediately and was cleared after a 20-minute interview in which they advised him to deactivate his facebook account.[352][353] new york post editor col allan stated, \"we stand by our story.the image was emailed to law enforcement agencies yesterday afternoon seeking information about these men, as our story reported.we did not identify them as suspects.\"the two were implied to be possible suspects via crowdsourcing on the websites reddit[353] and 4chan.[354]several other people were mistakenly identified as suspects.[355] two of those wrongly identified as suspects on reddit were the 17-year-old track star noted above and sunil tripathi, a brown university student missing since march.[356][357] tripathi was found dead on april 23 in the providence river.[358]on april 17, the fbi released the following statement:contrary to widespread reporting, no arrest has been made in connection with the boston marathon attack.over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate.since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.[359][360]the decision to release the photos of the tsarnaev brothers was made in part to limit damage done to those misidentified on the internet and by the media, and to address concerns over maintaining control of the manhunt.[72]film adaptation [ edit ]a film about the bombing and the subsequent manhunt, patriots day, was released in december 2016.another film, stronger, which chronicles the experience of survivor jeff bauman, was released in september 2017.see also [ edit ]^ [115] taxi service was restored before the

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0128", "doctext": "boston bomb suspect sent to federal medical detentionboston marathon bombing suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev has been moved to a prison medical facility as authorities continue to search for answers about the attack.the u.s. marshals service said friday that tsarnaev was moved to the federal medical center devens, a bureau of prisons facility in the northeastern state of massachusetts. he was transferred there from a boston hospital where he had been receiving treatment for injuries sustained during his capture last week.federal medical center devens, ayer, massachusettsa spokesman did not give details about the condition of the 19-year-old, who officials say is recovering from a neck wound.tsarnaev's brother and alleged co-conspirator, 26-year-old tamerlan tsarnaev, died in a confrontation with police last week.also friday, fbi agents searched a landfill near the campus of the university of massachusetts dartmouth, where dzhokhar tsarnaev was a student. officials did not say what investigators were looking for.in washington, lawmakers said that authorities are trying to determine whether or not the brothers' mother was involved in the radicalization of her two sons. the top democrat on the house intelligence committee, dutch ruppersberger, said she is a \"person of interest.\"the associated press reported friday that the bombing suspects' mother, zubeidat tsarnaeva, had been added to a federal terrorism database about 18 months before the boston attack.in russia, tsarnaeva and her former husband, anzor, said thursday their sons did not carry out the boston attack that killed three people and injured more than 250 others. in a news conference in makhachkala, the parents said their sons were framed, and the mother accused u.s. authorities of needlessly killing tamerlan.\"what have you done with my son? he was alive. why did they need to kill him? why didn't they send him to, you know, guantanamo or wherever? why did they kill him? why? why did they have to kill him? they got him alive, right? he was in their hands,'' she said.tsarnaeva said she would not accept that her sons had planted the bombs.dzhokhar tsarnaev faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction, which carries a possible death sentence if he is convicted.new york officials say the suspects were devising a plan to attack times square as they were running from authorities. new york police chief ray kelly said dzhokhar told investigators they planned to drive to new york to set off their remaining explosives.he said the plan fell apart when they realized the vehicle they had hijacked was running low on gas. when they stopped to refuel, the driver of the car escaped, and alerted police to their location.new york mayor michael bloomberg said the incident shows that new york, which was hit by terrorist attacks in 2001 that killed nearly 3,000 people, remains an inviting target.\"the fact is new york city remains a prime target for those who hate america and want to kill americans,\" said bloomberg.u.s. officials are continuing to examine whether the boston marathon attack could have been prevented, as warning signs emerged that tamerlan was turning toward extremism.senator lindsey graham said he believes boston is becoming \"a case study in system failure\" by u.s. intelligence agencies.“we need to understand that bin laden may be dead, but the war against radical islam is very much alive. radical islam is on the march and we need to up our game,” said graham.authorities say tamerlan tsarnaev was placed on a u.s. counter-terrorism list in late 2011.the officials say the cia asked that his name be placed on the list after the agency was contacted by the russian government with its concerns that he had become a radical islamist.moscow also issued a similar warning on him to the fbi earlier in 2011. officials say the agency launched an investigation, but eventually concluded he posed no threat.u.s. lawmakers have raised concerns about information sharing between u.s. law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the aftermath of the boston marathon attack. authorities will brief the full u.s. senate on the investigation into the bombing.several months after he first came to the attention of u.s. federal agents, tamerlan tsarnaev left the u.s. in january 2012 for a six-month visit to russia. u.s. investigators questioned the suspects' parents in the russian republic of dagestan to try to determine if tamerlan had contacts with islamic extremists. the family is originally from chechnya, where muslim insurgents have for decades been engaged in a bloody conflict with russia.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "transport", "Transporter": [], "PassengerArtifact": [[["suspect",

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0129", "doctext": "us jury to decide: death or life in prison for boston marathon bomberafter convicting chechen immigrant dzhokhar tsarnaev of the deadly 2013 boston marathon bombings, jurors will take a few days off before deciding whether to sentence him to death or life in prison.after two days of deliberations in a federal trial, the jury convicted tsarnaev wednesday of all 30 charges he faced, including 17 that carry a possible death penalty. the sentencing phase of the trial, which could begin as early as monday, will be held in the same u.s. courtroom.jurors would have to vote unanimously to sentence the 21-year-old to death.the defense lawyers, who barely cross-examined the prosecution's witnesses during the first part of the trial, are expected to become much more aggressive during the penalty phase, when they will make a case that tsarnaev's life should be spared.convictiontsarnaev's conviction was practically a foregone conclusion: his lawyers admitted he participated in the bombings, in which two homemade, shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs were placed near the finish line of the annual race. the explosion killed three people, including an 8-year-old boy, and injured another 264, with 17 people losing limbs and many others maimed from flying shrapnel.but during the trial, defense attorney judy clarke argued that tsarnaev, then 19, fell under the influence of his radicalized older brother, tamerlan, 26.clarke, who has successfully kept other notorious u.s. murder convicts off death row, told the jury in her closing argument, \"if not for tamerlan, it [the bombing] would not have happened.\"tamerlan tsarnaev was killed days after the april 15, 2013, blasts, when he was shot by police and run over by his brother during a chaotic getaway attempt. the brothers also shot to death a university patrol officer while attempting to flee authorities.dzhokhar tsarnaev, who lived in the united states for a decade before the bombings, was later found hiding in a boat parked in the backyard of a suburban boston home.prosecutors said he scrawled a motive for the attack on the inside wall of the boat, writing that the brothers were trying to avenge american attacks on muslims in the u.s. wars in iraq and afghanistan.defense caselegal analysts said they don't expect the defense case to contain any new revelations about tsarnaev.\"the crime is so horrific that they don't have much else really to point to, other than his age and the influence of his older brother,\" said dan collins, a former federal prosecutor who handled the case against a suspect in the 2008 terrorist attacks in mumbai, india.\"at this point, it's going to be the life experiences and the perspectives of the jurors in deciding whether or not they believe that these points are strong enough that his life should be spared,\" collins said.meg penrose, a death penalty expert and professor at texas a&m university school of law, said it will be difficult for the jury to overcome the image of tsarnaev planting a bomb just behind a group of children, including 8-year-old martin richard, who was killed.\"in a crime of this magnitude, what american citizen wouldn't ask, 'what would drive a person to do this?' and, as a juror, the question becomes, what answer would satisfy you?\" she said.massachusetts has not executed anyone since 1947.the city's mayor, marty walsh, said he was glad to see the trial moving toward a conclusion.\"i am thankful that this phase of the trial has come to an end and am hopeful for a swift sentencing process,\" walsh said. \"i hope [wednesday’s] verdict provides a small amount of closure for the survivors, families, and all impacted by the violent and tragic events.\"tsarnaev relativemeanwhile, in russia, a relative of the brothers said she remains \"completely convinced that they were not guilty of this.\"\"these boys didn't need this,\" rosa tsarnaeva, a 66-year-old cousin of tsarnaev's father, told the associated press. \"they never saw war, they were little when they arrived in the u.s. and grew up there.\"no one in the tsarnaev family, none of the relatives, ever took part in the military campaigns in chechnya\" in which separatists, some of them radical islamists, fought two wars against russian troops, she said.the brothers' father, who also lives in russia, has not answered repeated phone calls or responded to text messages seeking his comment.some material for this report came from ap and reuters.watch a related video report by voa's zlatica hoke:video

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0136", "doctext": "wealth of clues led to quick arrest of new york suspected bombernew york — the man suspected of planting bombs in a new york neighborhood and a new jersey seaside town may have aimed to inflict carnage incognito, but he didn't succeed for long in concealing his identity.ahmad khan rahami provided investigators with a wealth of clues that led to his arrest about 50 hours after the first explosion, according to three law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation.his fingerprints and dna were found at the scene of the manhattan bombing, they said. his uncovered face was clearly captured by surveillance cameras near the spot of the blast.electronic toll records show a car to which he had access was driven from new jersey to manhattan and back to new jersey the day of the bombing, according to the officials, who spoke to the associated press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss an ongoing case.those and other clues spurred officials to publicize his name and photo monday morning, asking for help finding rahami, 28, a muslim u.s. citizen born in afghanistan, who lives with his family in elizabeth, new jersey.as the investigation heated up, a bar owner in linden, new jersey, reported someone asleep in his doorway. an officer went to investigate and recognized the man as rahami, police and the mayor said.rahami pulled a gun and shot the officer — who was wearing a bulletproof vest — in the torso, and more officers joined in a running gun battle along the street and brought rahami down, police capt. james sarnicki said. another police officer was grazed by a bullet.\"a lot of technology involved in this, but a lot of good, old-fashioned police work, too,\" said new york police commissioner james o'neill. he said now, investigators would \"make sure that we get to the bottom of who's involved and why.\"after surgery for a gunshot wound to his leg, rahami was being held on $5.2 million bail, charged with five counts of attempted murder of police officers. federal prosecutors said they still were weighing charges over the bombings. rahami remains hospitalized.messages left for family members were not immediately returned. it wasn't clear when rahami would get an attorney.officials said they have no other suspects at large, but cautioned they are still investigating.the bombing spread fear across the new york area and revived anxiety about homegrown terrorism nationwide.as the east coast was rattled by the bombings, a man who authorities say referred to allah wounded nine people in a stabbing rampage at a minnesota mall saturday before being shot to death by an off-duty police officer. authorities are investigating the stabbings as a possible terrorist attack but have not drawn any connection between the bloodshed there and the bombings.william sweeney jr., the fbi's assistant director in new york, said there was no indication so far that the bombings were the work of a larger terror cell.rahami wasn't on any terror or no-fly watch lists, though he had been interviewed for immigration purposes traveling between the u.s. and afghanistan, one of the law enforcement officials said.rahami and his family live above their restaurant — called first american fried chicken — and the family has clashed with the city over closing times and noise complaints, which the rahamis said in a lawsuit were tinged with anti-muslim sentiment.the lawsuit was terminated in 2012 because one of rahami's brothers had pleaded guilty to blocking police from enforcing closing hours at the restaurant.a childhood friend, flee jones, said rahami had become more religious after returning from a trip to afghanistan several years ago. still, some of the family restaurant's customers said rahami was more likely to talk about his interest in cars than to mention faith.\"he's a very friendly guy,\" patron ryan mccann said. \"that's what's so scary.\"the investigation began when a pipe bomb blew up saturday morning in seaside park, new jersey, before a charity race to benefit marines. no one was injured.then a shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bomb exploded saturday night in new york's chelsea section, wounding 29 people, none seriously. an unexploded pressure-cooker bomb was found blocks away.late sunday night, five explosive devices were discovered in a trash can at an elizabeth train station, about 3 miles from where rahami was later found asleep in the doorway of a bar.investigators are still gathering evidence and have not publicly tied rahami to those devices, though sweeney noted they aren't \"ruling anything out.\"the bombs discovered saturday all used flip cellphones as a trigger and were all made with easily purchasable materials, a federal law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said.after zeroing in on rahami and learning of the car that had traveled between new jersey and new york, authorities pulled it over sunday night after it headed in the direction of kennedy airport. the law enforcement officials said at least one of rahami's relatives was in the car.all five were questioned and released, sweeney said. he declined to say whether they might later face charges.around the time rahami was captured, president barack obama was in new york on a previously scheduled visit for a meeting of the u.n. general assembly. he called on americans to show the world \"we will never give in to fear.\"", "templates": [{"incident_type": "arrest", "Jailer":

airport bombings and the apparent getaway of the third surviving suspect -- often identified in the media as \"the man with the hat.\" local media previously released security camera video of the man at zaventem airport shortly before the bombings, wearing a hat and a light jacket and walking alongside suicide bombers ibrahim el-bakraoui and najim laachraoui. all three men are seen pushing carts with bags on them.with running commentary in french and flemish, the police footage shows the third man leaving the airport after the bombs went off at 7:58 a.m. first he is walking, then he breaks into a jog. his face is not seen clearly in the new images.watch video released by fedpol belgium:we are sorry, but this feature is currently not availableaccording to belgian authorities, the man walked more then 10 kilometers in the ensuring hours, crossing the town of zaventem with video finally showing him in the schaerbeek area of brussels, before disappearing at a crossroads at 09:50 local time. police say he got rid of his jacket along the way, and subsequent footage shows him in shirtsleeves. he is described as wearing a light blue shirt, dark pants and brown shoes with wide white soles.asking for citizens' help belgian police have released local and international phone numbers for people to call if they have any information on the man or a jacket that looks like the one in the video.the brussels airport attacks, along with a suicide bombing at the maelbeek metro station in the belgian capital about an hour later, killed 32 people and wounded more than 340.this photo

brahim bakraoui.ibrahim el-bakraoui’s brother, khalid, was named as the suicide bomber in the metro attack. both brothers had criminal records. turkish authorities had earlier caught ibrahim el-bakraoui trying to cross into syria and deported him.authorities have found a tangle of links between the brussels attacks suspects and those involved in the november attacks in paris — including surviving paris attacks suspect salah abdeslam, who is believed to have been in charge of logistics. the islamic state militant group claimed responsibility for both attacks.born in france but brought up in belgium, abdeslam was arrested days before the brussels attacks and is currently in a high-security belgian prison awaiting extradition to france. that move had been expected to be imminent, but his belgian lawyer, sven mary, told journalists thursday that abdeslam’s extradition would not happen for several weeks.lawyer mary also said abdeslam was not formally implicated to date in the

granada tv programme.the show was based on a book by campaigning mp, chris mullin, who said he met the real bombers, but could not reveal their identity.in another parliamentary report, the mp stated the programme-makers had also passed a special branch document containing details of interviews with an iraman to the home office. the unnamed terrorist had been arrested in november 1975 - six months after the trial and conviction of the birmingham six.mr mullin claimed the terrorist gave police accurate information including the names of some of those whom he said were responsible for the bombs.crucially, the papers contained the remark: 'so-and-so told me he put one of the bombs in the pub.'alongwithmurrayand the birmingham six two other men - including james kelly - were arrested in the immediate aftermath of the carnage.kelly was found guilty of possessing explosives and bizarrely claimed he was a spy who infiltrated the ira so he could later give help to the police.the birmingham six were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975 for the pub bombings. they were all belfast born but had lived in brum since the 1960s.five of them had left the city on the early evening of november 21 from new street station - hours before the explosions - to travel to belfast to attend mcdade's funeral. they were seen off by callaghan.the five were arrested at heysham that evening and callaghan was taken into custody the next day.all the men were interrogated by birmingham cid and claimed at trial they were beaten, threatened and forced to sign statements written by the police over three days of questioning.their convictions were overturned by the court of appeal in march1991and their case is seen as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in british legal history.terrorist activity was rife in the midlands during the 1970sand police arrested scores of ira members in the months following the bombings.but the ira unit which gained particular notoriety was the birmingham nine. they were responsible for 20 of the 31 bomb blasts in birmingham and parts of the west midlands between august 1973 and august 1974.patrick guilfoyle, martin coughlan, gerard young, joseph duffy, michael murray, anthony madigan, joseph ashe, gerald small and stephen blake conducted the biggest wave of bombings in the region since the second world war.coughlan and young were said to be the leading figures in the campaign.coughlan was born in dublin and came to birmingham in 1956. he rented a house in chelmsley wood with his wife and had three children.it is believed he was the brains behind the campaign of terror which began in birmingham and spread to manchester.guilfoyle never quite made the grade of bomber. he caused an explosion that badly injured one of his ira colleagues because he was smoking a cigarette while making a bomb.northern ireland historian david mcvea said: 'many different theories have been put forward as to who actually carried out the bombings, but it is unlikely that the true culprits will ever be identified.'the ira was very protective of its members at the time, people moved in and out of the different cells constantly. 'as well as the killing of so many innocent people the real tragedy is the wrongful jailing of the birmingham six.'the ira was able to use the injustice against these men to their advantage for years.'caption(s):slaughtered: victims are taken away from the pub bombings; devastated: wreckage outside the tavern in the town; dead: james mcdade; tribute: memorial to the victims", "templates": [{"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [[["mick murray", 978]]], "Target": [[["two pubs", 1051]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": [[["birmingham city", 1063]]]}, {"incident_type": "arrest", "Jailer": [], "Detainee": [[["the nine men", 1491]]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "convict", "JudgeCourt": [], "Defendant": [[["birmingham nine", 1392]]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["pubs", 1055]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [[["bombs", 2305]]], "Place": [[["birmingham city", 1063]]]}, {"incident_type": "charge", "Prosecutor": [[["west midlands police", 3116]]], "Defendant": [[["him", 1946]]], "JudgeCourt": [], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "arrest", "Jailer": [], "Detainee": [[["terrorist", 968]]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "convict", "JudgeCourt": [], "Defendant": [[["birmingham six", 1545]]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "arrest", "Jailer": [], "Detainee": [[["birmingham six", 1545]], [["james kelly", 4791]]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "sentence", "JudgeCourt": [], "Defendant": [[["birmingham six", 1545]]], "Crime": [], "Sentence": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "investigate", "Investigator": [[["birmingham cid", 5494]]], "Defendant": [[["men", 1299]]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [[["they", 5095]]], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [[["bomb", 875]]], "Place": [[["birmingham", 219]]]}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [[["stephen blake", 6279]], [["gerald small", 6262]], [["joseph ashe", 6249]], [["anthony madigan", 6232]], [["michael murray", 6216]], [["joseph duffy", 6202]], [["gerard young", 6188]], [["martin coughlan", 6171]], [["patrick guilfoyle", 6152]]], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": [[["region", 1328]]]}]}

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0142", "doctext": "washington – two drones packed with explosives reportedly flew toward venezuelan president nicolas maduro on saturday night in what the government has described as a failed assassination attempt.here's a look at the details:what happened?assailants launched two drones filled with a total of more than 4 pounds of plastic explosives toward maduro, his wife and other top venezuelan leaders, according to the associated press.the attack occurred while maduro was making a speech at a huge outdoor event in caracas to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the country's national guard. one of the drones was set to explode above the president while the second was set to detonate in front of him, according to interior minister nestor reverol.the venezuelan military knocked one of the drones off-course electronically. the second drone crashed into an apartment building about two blocks from where maduro was speaking to hundreds of troops, reverol said.photos taken at the event showed security officers surrounding maduro with some sort of large black shields as they escorted him away.\"that drone came after me,\" maduro said. \"but there was a shield of love that always protects us. i’m sure i’ll live for many more years.\"who launched the drone attack?the venezuelan government alleges that maduro's political opponents conspired with individuals in miami and bogota, colombia, to try to kill maduro. they have so far offered no real proof to support this claim, and opposition leaders charge that maduro is using the attack as an excuse to crack down on his critics.government authorities said sunday that they have detained six people – whom they described as \"terrorists and assassins\" – in connection with the attack. among those detained: a man who took part in 2014 protests against the government and a man who had a warrant out for his arrest for attacking a military barracks.maduro accused the “far right,” working with conspirators in miami and bogota –including colombian president juan manuel santos – of launching the attack. colombia’s government has denied any role in the violence.maduro, who accuses the u.s. of supporting his opponents, called on president donald trump to hold the \"terrorist group\" accountable.john bolton, trump's national security adviser, said sunday he would like to see solid evidence to support maduro's claims.\"if the government of venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of u.s. criminal law, we’ll take a serious look at it,\" bolton said on \"fox news sunday.\"what is the political and economic situation in venezuela?venezuela is in the midst of an economic crisis that has been described as worse than the great depression that devastated the united states and much of the rest of the world in the 1930s.the inflation rate is set to hit a stunning 13,000 percent this year. there are shortages of food and medicine and a soaring crime rate, spurring refugees to flee into neighboring countries. more than 600,000 venezuelans have crossed into colombia, and brazil has declared a state of emergency because of all the venezuelans sweeping into that nation.maduro is viewed by the united states and other democratic countries as a corrupt, left-wing dictator who imposes strict controls on his people and on the press. he won re-election to a six-year term in may, but the process was widely viewed as a rigged farce.the trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on venezuela immediately after the election in an effort to stop maduro from selling off government debt to enrich himself.what could happen next?reverol said there could be more arrests. critics fear an even greater government crackdown on maduro's political opponents.\"the investigation will get to the bottom of this,\" maduro said. \"no matter who falls.\"more:venezuelan president nicolas maduro says drone

united in confronting it,” duque said in a tweet. “we won’t bend in the face of violence.”investigators had identified the car’s driver as josé aldemar rojas rodríguez, who was among the dead, said the colombian attorney general, néstor humberto martínez.he said the vehicle, a gray nissan patrol suv, was carrying 80kg (176lb) of the high explosive pentolite, which has been used in the past by colombian guerrillas.there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack and martínez said investigators were searching for its “intellectual authors”.for decades, residents of bogotá lived in fear of being caught in a bombing by leftist rebels or pablo escobar’s medellín drug cartel. but as colombia’s conflict has wound down, and the nation’s largest rebel group disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.facebook twitter pinterest smouldering remains of car bomb are seen in this screengrab outside bogotá police academy.authorities

a standoff with the conservative duque over how to restart stalled peace talks.colombian rebels blamed for killing spree 400 miles inside venezuela read morethe group known was long considered a lesser military threat than the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc), whose 7,000 guerrilla fighters disarmed as part of a 2016 peace accord. but in the wake of the peace deal, the cuban-inspired insurgency has been gaining strength, especially along the eastern border with venezuela, where it has carried out a number of kidnappings and bombings of oil pipelines. that has hardened duque’s resolve in refusing to resume peace talks that have been stalled since he took office last august.thursday’s bombing was the deadliest in the capital since an explosion at the upmarket andino shopping mall in june 2017 killed three people, including a french woman, and injured another 11. police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the people revolutionary’s movement for the bombing.but it has been more than a decade since a police or military installation in the capital has suffered a major bombing. a blast at a military university in 2006 left almost two dozen people injured.ariel ávila, an analyst who tracks violence, said that in the last four years, there have been 28 attacks in the capital with explosives. while the majority has been carried out with low-grade homemade materials and grenades that have damaged property but left no casualties, he said police intelligence and checkpoints surrounding the city need to be reinforced to prevent more attacks.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["people", 32]]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [],

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0144", "doctext": "scotland yard are searching for a group of about five people, including a \"baby faced\" teenage youth, in the wake of two bomb explosions at king's cross and euston stations in london yesterday.thirteen people were injured, three seriously, in the lunchtime explosions. the attacks are the latest in the provisional ira's three week old bombing campaign in england carried out by small active service units. at king's cross a 15 to 17-year-old youth ran on to platform 8 and threw a brown paper parcel into the entrance of the old booking hall at 12.24 p.m.the youth described by one of the five injured in the blast as baby faced and \"too young to shave\" sprinted out of the station seconds before the 3lb. bomb exploded. a coded call gave police a three-minute warning of a second bomb at euston which exploded at 1.16 p.m. in the railbar injuring eight people.scotland yard said that the call, telephoned to the press association news agency was in the name of the same group which has given warnings about previous bombs in london. the caller, a man with an irish accent, is believed to be responsible for all the warnings.commander robert huntley, who is heading the investigation said the name of the group used in the calls enabled scotland yard to distinguish the real warnings from the hundreds of hoax calls. he would not disclose the code name but denied that the code name \"persuaders\" - given to birmingham police before the blast on sunday night - had been used in london.the commander attacked the hoax callers who were responsible yesterday for the closure of most main line stations in london while bomb searches were made.charing cross station was evacuated after an anonymous bomb warning to the sloane telephone exchange at 4.55p.m. after a search, passengers were allowed back at 5.30.euston was also cleared after receiving a rush-hour threat. other searches were made after calls to paddington, waterloo and london bridge.mr huntley said yesterday's explosions, which followed the weekend attack on victoria station, appeared to be similar to the previous bombings and that the devices were \"typical of ira manufacture.\" a piece of battery and part of a clock spring were found amid the debris at euston, suggesting the charge had been timed and primed in exactly the same manner as other bombs.the police believe that the ira are using at least two small squads of bombers operating in london and the midlands who are almost constantly on the move living in cheap hotels and boarding houses.asked about previous claims from commander ernest bond that the bombers were close to arrest, mr huntley said he did not think the statement had been over-optimistic. certain evidence had been compiled on those thought to be responsible. he indicated that the gang members were interchangeable and might not even live in this country.commander huntley said the bombers' tactics were now clear. the three-minute warning at euston indicated that the aim of the bomb was \"to cause injury and destruction\" in a crowded station. he appealed for the public not to leave parcels, luggage, and containers unattended in public places but to keep property with them at all times.all those seriously injured yesterday were at kings cross - a chinese couple from hull and a london man. mr anthony barber, the chancellor, was sitting in a train which had just arrived when the bomb exploded. he joined the crowd helping the injured and asked if there was anything he could do.although scotland yard are privately convinced that the recent wave of bombings has been the work of the provisional ira, police have failed to discover signs of a widespread ira organisation in england.it seems likely that the bombing teams are either recruited in england, from outside the ranks of republican organisations and sympathisers, or are briefed and armed in ireland and sent over individually.a small and changing group of four to six people operating alone in the london area without recourse to or contact with known republicans living here has largely neutralised the intelligence gathered by the special branch on irish militants.the fact that the provisionals' leadership has not yet claimed responsibility from dublin has little bearing on its involvement. the salient point is that the provos have always been quick to disclaim responsibility for incidents in which they are not involved and no such disclaimer has been issued.while it might well be true that extremists in england have taken advantage of the confusion created by the bombings to plant their own explosive devices, informed sources in dublin consider it certain that the present campaign was both planned and approved by the ira army council in dublin.the explosions have almost certainly gone beyond what the provisionals had originally intended but they see no reason to help scotland yard by claiming or disclaiming responsibility.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["king's cross", 140]], [["stations", 164]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [[["bomb", 121]]], "Place": [[["london", 176]]]}, {"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["people", 54]], [["three", 223]]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["five", 49]]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [[["bomb", 121]]], "Place": [[["railbar", 832]]]}, {"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["people", 54]]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [[["bomb", 121]]], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["those", 2719]]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "contact", "Participant": [[["republicans", 4010]]], "Topic": [], "Place": []}]}

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0152", "doctext": "(cnn) a federal appeals court ruled on friday to vacate the death sentence of dzhokhar tsarnaev , who along with his brother planted homemade bombs near the finish of the 2013 boston marathon, killing three spectators and injuring hundreds.the court also ruled to set aside three of his 30 convictions but said he will remain in federal prison for the rest of his life.the court ruled tsarnaev should be given a new penalty phase trial, where a new set of jurors can again decide if he should be sentenced to death.tsarnaev, now 27, will remain incarcerated and is being held at the nation's most secure federal prison in florence, colorado.\"and just to be crystal clear: because we are affirming the convictions (excluding the three ... convictions) and the many life sentences imposed on those remaining counts (which dzhokhar has not challenged), dzhokhar will remain confined to prison for the rest of his life, with the only question remaining being whether the government will end his life by executing him,\" the opinion, authored by circuit court judge ojetta rogeriee thompson, says.tsarnaev was convicted in 2015, including for the deaths of krystle campbell lingzi lu at the marathon and police officer sean collier, separately.around-the-clock coveragetsarnaev's legal team had pushed to change the venue of the trial to a courthouse that wasn't so close to the site of the bombing, in the heart of a town so affected by the tragedy.the appeals court judges agreed, saying, \"one could not turn on the radio either without hearing something about these stunningly sad events.\"the appeals judges ruled that us district court judge george o'toole, who oversaw tsarnaev's trial, \"fell short\" of his promise to question jurors thoroughly enough to identify the degree to which they had been exposed to facts of the case through media coverage, \"providing sufficient ground to vacate his death sentences.\"part of the appeals court's ruling was a decision to reverse three convictions for charges that tsarnaev was carrying a firearm in connection with his possession of a pressure cooker bomb.the ruling tells the district court to enter judgments of acquittal on those charges, put together a new jury and preside over a new trial that strictly focuses on what penalty tsarnaev should receive for the counts that are eligible for the death penalty.tsarnaev's attorneys had filed a post-trial motion for judgments of acquittal on these convictions that the district court judge denied.cnn has reached out to tsarnaev's legal team for comment on the ruling.the ruling also states that the judges make no judgment about whether boston is a \"proper venue\" for a sentencing retrial, and says it is a decision that should be left to the us district court for massachusetts, where the initial trial was held.the us attorney's office said: \"we are currently reviewing the opinion and are declining further comment at this time.\"tsarnaev was 19 years old when he and his brother, tamerlan, who was 26 years old at the time, went to boston's boylston street shortly before 3 p.m. on april 15, 2013, to carry out their plotsurveillance video showed the brothers carrying the pressure cooker bombs in backpacks and moving through the crowd near the marathon finish line in what federal prosecutors called a coordinated attack.tamerlan set off the first bomb, a 6-quart pressure cooker that contained gunpowder, nails and bbs, prosecutors said.the bomb killed campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager, and permanently injured several other people who lost their legs.the second pressure cooker bomb, carried in by dzhokhar, went off 12 seconds later and killed two people, martin and lu, a graduate student from china.the bombings sparked a manhunt for days that shut down the city and resulted in wall-to-wall coverage of the search.the brothers, while on the run, killed massachusetts institute of technology police officer sean collier.after they stole an suv, the two were chased by police.tamerlan died in an explosive firefight with police in nearby watertown.dzhokhar was arrested a day later.victims, families to relive another trialthe decision to order a new trial will be difficult for the families of victims, boston mayor marty walsh said after the decision came down on friday.\"i think the concern that some families have had from the very beginning was that this day was going to come, where they would have to relive another trial, and you know they shouldn't have to relive another trial,\" walsh said.\"the only thing that i'll say is a positive ... this guy will never see the light of day again.he's going to live within those four walls.he got exactly what he deserved.\"shortly after tsarnaev was found guilty on all counts, the parents of 8-year-old martin richard, who was killed in the bombing, publicly pleaded for prosecutors not to pursue the death sentence in the penalty phase of the trial.\"we hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring,\" the parents wrote in a column in the boston globe.\"as long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours.the minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and tv screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family.\"cnn has reached out to the richard family for comment on friday's ruling.",

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0153", "doctext": "one day in march an american drone circled above pakistan's north waziristan tribal area, zeroed in on a gathering of village men, some of whom were armed, and unleashed three missiles in quick succession. it turned out to be a meeting to settle a dispute over a chromite mine. most of the 40 or so killed were civilians, according to accounts, though a dozen taliban also died in the attack, including a local commander, sherabat khan. the taliban nowadays often adjudicate quarrels in the tribal areas, a wild buffer zone that runs along pakistan's border with afghanistan.the attack illustrated two problems with the drone war in the tribal regions: the risk of civilian casualties, and pakistan's ambiguous attitude towards america's use of drones. pakistan's army chief, ashfaq kayani, called the strike a “complete violation of human rights”. for pakistan, the difficulty went beyond civilian casualties. khan was a lieutenant of a notable warlord, gul bahadur. but pakistan considers mr bahadur to be a “good taliban”, ie, one who has agreed to fight only in afghanistan, not on pakistani soil. after the strike, he threatened to tear up the deal.relations between the governments in islamabad, pakistan's capital, and washington, dc, are deeply troubled by the issue of drones. though it publicly denounces the drone strikes, pakistan certainly does not want all of them stopped. indeed, the co-operation of pakistani intelligence is crucial to employing the drones. but the army wants the number of strikes reduced, concentrating on targets both countries can agree on. america has told pakistan bluntly it must either flush the taliban and other jihadists out of their safe havens in north waziristan, or it will continue with what amounts to an assassination campaign there. pakistan says it cannot launch a ground offensive in north waziristan because its armed forces are already stretched.the drone attacks, a supposedly “secret” programme started by the cia in 2004, have been ramped up over the past three years, with a record 118 strikes last year and 50 so far in 2011. the drones started under president pervez musharraf, the former military ruler. there were just nine strikes from 2004 to the end of 2007. according to pakistani officials, it was supposed to be a highly selective programme for eliminating terrorist leaders in the tribal areas, under an understanding that gave the americans the use of at least one remote pakistani air base for the drones. the drones also take off from afghanistan, but are operated thousands of miles away by a “pilot” at a desk in america, watching a video feed from the aircraft. a successful hit is known in the cia as a “bugsplat”. it is all horribly like a video game.the new america foundation, a washington think-tank, found that up to 2,551 people have been killed in the strikes since 2004. based on press reports, it estimates that 80% of them were militants, rising to a pretty astonishing 95% in 2010. in recent months, there has been a move away from blowing up compounds to targeting vehicles, where militants can more easily be hit without killing civilians. even for compounds, smaller missiles are used to try to limit the damage to the separate male living quarters. perceptions on the ground, however, are often different. the foundation's own poll in the tribal areas last year found only 16% believe the drones accurately target militants. but many locals privately support the strikes against extremists who have overrun their homeland.accepting the figure for the success rate in killing militants nevertheless means that fully 500 or so pakistani civilians have been killed since 2004. unlike, say, in the war in afghanistan, there is no investigation of civilian casualties, and no compensation paid. transparency and accountability are absent, and some question the legal basis of the attacks. the programme is a charade because the cia never admits to it and pakistan pretends that it does not co-operate. a legal action launched this month, initially in pakistan, with the backing of reprieve, a campaigning group, seeks the arrest of a former cia lawyer, john rizzo, who boasted in a magazine interview this year that he used to approve a monthly list of some 30 individuals to be targeted by the drones.whatever the outcome of that case, a debate will grind on about whether the strikes are harming al-qaeda and related groups, or spurring on afghanistan's powerful insurgency. according to the new america foundation, out of the 2,600-odd deaths, 35 were recognised militant chiefs, or just 1.3% of the total. among the successes was the fearsome leader of the pakistani taliban, baitullah mehsud, who was the country's number one public enemy. still, the vast majority of targets have been low-level fighters. all the while, the number of suicide attacks in afghanistan, many launched from pakistan, has soared over the past year or more.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "die", "Victim": [[["so", 131]], [["40", 290]]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type":

presumably policemen, soldiers and prison officers and others unfortunate enough to be designated as legitimate targets. many of these too, even allowing the doubtful premise of legitimacy were shot down in ambush, in cold blood in the domestic situation, but so, republicans will argue were many of their victims too.the statement does go on to recognise the hurt of all victims, combatant and non-combatant, and it would be ungenerous not to recognise the impulse for reconciliation which lies behind these words - or the effort that has been required to bring it about. thirty years ago even innocent victims were dismissed as the unfortunate casualties of war, in the wrong place at the wrong time. things have moved a long way when all can be seen as victims, when the hurts of all can be recognised.when the ira first announce a ceasefire, they were castigated for not including some phrase of regret, some words of apology. this was further highlighted when some weeks later gusty spence announced the loyalist ceasefire in terms which included an apology for hurts inflicted which was quite moving at the time. subsequent loyalist activity has not eradicated the value of that statement in that context. neither should current disturbances or uncertainties be used to denigrate the ira statement.some elements of unionism will remain implacable no matter what republicans say or do. others will demand additional deeds rather than words. others still will argue a lack of moral equivalency, that illegality can never be legitimised or terrorism condoned. the important thing now is how that statement and the sentiments behind it, which should be recognised as genuine and not merely a rhetorical or political ploy are accepted by those who have been on the receiving end by the relatives of victims and survivors, many of whom have been horribly mutilated.in general, such people have proved to be much more willing to forgive than those who have suffered by proxy. those who experienced bloody friday in belfast may welcome the statement more than those who viewed it from afar. in any case, to recall the events shows how far society has moved on towards peace since then.for the long suffering populace of northern ireland, like the mothers in o'casey's play \"on either side of a scales of sorrow, weighed down by the bodies of our suffering sons\", this is a significant and a very welcome statement.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [[["bombs", 253]]], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}]}

thai police stand on the balcony outside of an apartment building in nong jok on the outskirts of bangkok, aug. 29, 2015. thai police say they arrested a suspect in the blast at the erawan shrine in this apartment building.the components were said to be similar to those used in devices that detonated at the erawan shrine on august 17 and in the chao phraya river, adjacent to the sathorn pier, the following day.the blast at the hindu shrine, popular with chinese and other asian tourists, killed 20 people and wounded more than 100 others – the worst single mass casualty attack in thailand.the subsequent explosion at the pier caused no injuries. uighur deportationit is unclear whether the shrine bombing has any connection to thailand’s deportation in july of more than 100 ethnic uighurs to china, army commander-in-chief general udomdej sitabutr said monday.thai authorities have been hesitant to link the attack to international terrorism.instead, authorities have insisted since saturday that it is likely connected to a human smuggling organized crime ring or a gang bent on revenge for crackdowns by police.analysts have given those explanations little credence and human rights groups have expressed concern about how the lack of legitimate political, security and judicial authority in a country under military government could undermine public trust in the investigation’s outcome.the head of the thai military junta, prime minister prayuth chan-ocha, has cautioned against concluding that the shrine bombing was linked to international terrorism or mentioning any possible connection to turkey.thai police lieutenant general prawut thavornsiri speaks to the media at the royal thai police headquarters in bangkok, thailand, aug. 30, 2015.in recent days speculation had increased about the bombing’s possible link to china's ethnic uighur minority or their co-religious sympathizers in turkey.thailand's deportation of the uighurs led to an attack on the thai consulate in istanbul where windows were smashed.the turkish embassy in bangkok denied that the arrested suspect is a citizen of turkey, lt. general prawut told reporters on sunday.authorities also made conflicting statements saturday and sunday on whether they believed the man was the suspect caught on closed circuit television images leaving a package at the popular hindu shrine in central bangkok just prior to the explosion.criticizedthe junta also came under criticism after airing a photograph of a suicide vest while its officials discussed evidence found on saturday they said was related to the bombings.it was quickly pointed out that the picture of the vest had come from a 2013 blog online of the u.s. transportation security administration.that disclosure prompted thai authorities to acknowledge the photograph had no connection to their case and they demanded the media and public refrain from further disseminating the picture.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [[["bomb", 109]]], "Place": [[["bangkok", 25]]]}, {"incident_type": "arrest", "Jailer": [[["suspects", 249]], [["woman", 279]], [["man", 281]]], "Detainee": [], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "arrest", "Jailer": [[["suspects", 249]]], "Detainee": [], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "charge", "Prosecutor": [], "Defendant": [[["suspect", 249]]], "JudgeCourt": [], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "arrest", "Jailer": [[["they", 1490]]], "Detainee": [[["suspect", 249]]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["erawan shrine", 1848]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [[["devices", 1945]]], "Place": [[["chao phraya river", 2013]]]}, {"incident_type": "die", "Victim": [[["people", 2168]]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["shrine", 2103]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "crime", "Perpetrator": [[["ring", 766]], [["gang", 2739]]], "Victim": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "crime", "Perpetrator": [[["gang", 2739]], [["ring", 766]]], "Victim": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["shrine", 2103]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [[["suspects", 6]]], "Target": [[["bangkok", 25]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "attack", "Attacker": [], "Target": [], "Instrument": [], "Place": [[["thailand", 2251]]]}, {"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["others", 2201]]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}]}
{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0157", "doctext": "the impact shattered windows, damaged cars and sent crowds running from the scene at an hour when chelsea, always a popular destination, was filled with residents and tourists.“it was the biggest blast i ever would imagine, lights flashing, glass shattering,” said a woman who was injured in the explosion.the force of the explosion, she said, flung her into the air.“it happened so fast i was thrown up and landed down, i didn’t know where it had come from,” said the woman, who would give only her first name, helena, as she hobbled out of bellevue hospital center about 4 a.m. after she was treated for injuries to her eye and legs. “i realized there was blood streaming down my face, and i couldn’t see out of my eye.”luke mcconnell, who was visiting from colorado, was headed toward a restaurant on west 27th street when the blast occurred. “i felt it, like a concussive wave, heading towards me.”“then there was a cloud of white smoke that came from the left side of 23rd street near sixth,” he said. “there was no fire, just smoke.”witnesses said they could feel the explosion from several blocks away. daniel yount, 34, said he was standing on the roof of a building at 25th street and the avenue of the americas with friends.“we felt the shock waves go through our bodies,” he said.it was a startling scene, full of dark possibilities, for a city that endured the attacks of sept. 11, 2001, but has so far been spared the kind of mayhem that has terrorized city after city around the world in the 15 years since.the closest new york has come to an attack was in 2010, when the police found a crude car bomb of propane, gasoline and fireworks inside a sport utility vehicle in times square. although the device had apparently started to detonate, there was no explosion.on saturday night in chelsea, the device found on west 27th street also caused no harm.images shared on social media and confirmed as authentic by a senior police official showed a silver-colored piece of cookware with wires and a cellphone attached.the official said the police department’s bomb squad was taking the device to a department facility in the bronx, where robots would inspect it.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "destroy", "Destroyer": [], "Artifact": [[["windows", 21]]], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "damage", "Damager": [], "Artifact": [[["cars", 38]]], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["she", 334]]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [[["legs", 630]], [["eye", 622]]], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "medical", "Treater": [], "Patient": [[["she", 334]]], "MedicalIssue": [], "Instrument": [], "Place": [[["bellevue hospital center", 542]]]}, {"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["times square", 1685]]], "Instrument": [[["car bomb", 1607]]], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": [[["new york", 1533]]]}, {"incident_type": "evacuation", "Transporter": [], "PassengerArtifact": [[["crowds", 52]]], "Vehicle": [], "Origin": [[["scene", 76]]], "Destination": []}, {"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["woman", 267]]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "contact", "Participant": [[["daniel yount", 1110]]], "Topic": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "contact", "Participant": [[["he", 1]]], "Topic": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "inspection", "Observer": [], "ObservedEntity": [[["it", 149]]], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}]}
{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0158", "doctext": "isis is reportedly packing drones with explosives nowan unconfirmed report from syria suggests that isis has started using small drones packed with explosives as weapons.the first attack was a failure, but if the report is accurate, then it signals a dangerous new terror threat.the report showed pictures of the remains of a homemade attack drone.it was apparently shot down, along with a second drone that exploded, by kurdish ypf (\"people's defence units\") fighters in syria.the caption says that both drones carried explosives, and that no ypf fighters were injured in the incident.unlike many jihadi groups, isis has proven itself tech-savvy—the organization is known for its use of social media, for instance.this latest development is not surprising, as it follows a long history of drone usage.in late 2014, during the battle for kobane, isis started using footage taken from dronesin their propaganda videos.around the same time, isis started using quadrotors for battlefield reconnaissance.a number of them, mainly dji quadrotors, were reportedly shot down or captured by kurdish fighters, according to a news report from december 2014.these drones were apparently used as artillery spotters, finding targets and correcting the fall or fire for mortar crews.by early this year, isis drones had become important enough to be targeted by u.s. airstrikes.a centcom report in march mentions that \"near fallujah, an airstrike destroyed an isil remotely piloted aircraft and an isil vehicle.\"\"we observed it flying for approximately 20 minutes.we observed it land.we observed the enemy place it in the trunk of a car and we struck the car,\" according to pentagon spokesman colonel steve warren.warren described the drone as \"a model airplane\" and \"commercially available, remotely piloted aircraft, really something anyone can get.\"another isis drone (\"remotely piloted vehicle\") was destroyed in an airstrike in june, and a third in august.friends of ypg ypjin fact, isis tactical drones seem to be appearing all over this year.in september the levant front (or jabhat al-shamiyya) released pictures of a camera-carrying talon drone they brought down, which they say was flown by isis.the x-uav talon is available in kit form for about $100; it is made of plywood with a six-foot wingspan and has a large fuselage compartment for cameras or other payloads.in october, iraqi police shot down a fixed-wing isis drone near ramadi.again it was of the small, hand-launched variety, though a different model, and the iraqis say it was photographing military units.even al-qaeda has released pictures and video of what is claims was a downed isis drone.this flurry of drone activity is a reflection of just how easy it has become to acquire and fly drones.just as home computers were once confined to dedicated hobbyists but found a wider market, drones have broken into the mainstream with models that require no piloting or technical skills to fly.this gives isis access to aerial reconnaissance that would otherwise be impossible in the face of the air superiority of syrian, russian, and western forces.the pictures of the isis attack drone were posted by a user called \"catelyn carrigan\" on the facebook page of the group \"friends of the ypg ypj\" with the headline \"ypg shoots down 2 isis drones.\"the location of the new pictures is given as \"southern kobanê, qracoezag province near the bridge.\"we received no response to queries for more information on the pictures.this would not be the first terrorist drone strike.hamas and hezbollah, for example, both have used fixed-wing kamikaze drones with explosive warheads, but those were larger, modified versions of military mirsad and ababbil drones supplied by iran.the isis drones do not rely on imported military technology, but can be assembled in a garage, for cheap.some eagled-eyed redditors believe the drone in question today is the skwalker x7 or x8, which costs $179 for the kit.as we've recently noted, small drones make effective battlefield weapons.the switchblade by american company aerovironment and the israeli hero-30 have both proven lethal, giving a foot soldier the power to launch his own airstrike to locate and hit a target from several miles away from behind cover.these military drones boast jam-proof communications, sophisticated terminal guidance, and advanced warheads.but even a crude, home-made version might be deadly in a terrorist attack against a soft target.during the recent terror attacks in paris, the attackers were unable to gain access to the stade de france, which was packed with fans for a soccer game.but drones cannot be stopped by walls or fences.while they can only carry a small amount of explosive compared to a suicide bomber, they can be deployed in significant numbers, and they can be directed with great accuracy against vulnerable targets.of course, security forces are already looking at how to mitigate the threat from small drones, and various defensive measures are already in place, from nets to electronic detectors and jammers.commercial drones can be stopped easily enough by jamming their control frequencies, or even hacking them to take over the drone, but purpose-built attack drones will be much harder to combat.small drones can be built for a few thousand dollars in any home workshop.3d printed drones are no longer a novelty, and how-to guides can be shared easily over the internet.it is far too late to stop this technology from proliferating.isis first drone attack may have failed, but it is not likely to be the last.it may be time to get serious about defending against small drones.david hambling's new bookswarm troopers:

commercial-level uavs intended for aerial photography and costing around $5000 each.the venezuelan government claims that each matrice was packed with a kilo of c4 and were intended to kill maduro and other important venezuelan political figures.https://www.wetalkuav.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1024x576_mp4_4439375926361635711.mp4a video of the drone exploding from media at the eventdji spoke with dezeen magazine and told them that \"dji makes products purely for peaceful purposes.\"\"while we build some prudent safety and security features into our products, we have limited ability to control what people do with them.\"they stated that the overwhelming majority of dji drone operators use their drones peacefully, and they \"deplore any use of our products to bring harm to anyone.\"\"as with any technology, if people decide to misuse our products in any way, they have to be responsible for their actions,\" they said.two dji matrice 600’s were seemingly used in an attack against president nicolás maduro in venezuela last week.who was responsible for the drone attacks and why did they fail?it is, as yet, unclear who exactly was reponsible for the attacks.one group calling themselves ‘soldiers in t-shirts‘ claimed responsibility on twitter.maduro alleged venezuela’s ultra-right in alliance with colombia’s ultra-right and their outgoing president, juan manuel santos were behind the assassination attempt.the venezuelan government has used the attacks as justification for a further crackdown on political opponents and have arrested at least 6 people.neither drone ultimately made it to their intended targets.according to venezuela’s attorney general, this was because they were deflected from reaching their intended course through protective radio emissions eminating from venzuelan intelligence personnel (similar to drone killing devices we’ve written about previously).video footage from multiple angles since the attack suggest that one drone exploded above the soldiers on parade (causing 7 injuries) while the other crashed into the window of an apartment, causing the apartment to catch fire (this was initially reported in some outlets as the result of gas explosion).the website bellingcat has an excellent rundown of all evidence related to the drone attack including video footage and photos from multiple angles, if you’re interested.a soldier injured by the exploding drone at the venezualan national guard celebration parade in caracasdespite some claims in media, it seems unlikely the government would stage an attack against itself.as the economist noted, \"dictators depend on projecting an image of omnipotence… in the television footage, mr maduro looked befuddled;

endowing president nicolás maduro with virtually unlimited powers, a vote total decried by domestic and foreign critics as a sham.venezuela’s national electoral council's estimated turnout sunday was more than double that of political opponents and independent experts.opposition leaders also said 12 people were killed in violence in the face of a massive presence of troops around the country on sunday. the government confirmed nine deaths.maduro, who faces a worsening economic crisis despite venezuela's enormous oil reserves, seeks to establish a friendly assembly that would bypass the opposition-controlled congress to rewrite the country’s 1999 constitution. opponents accuse him of trying to create a single-party, authoritarian system like that in cuba.electoral council president tibisay lucena announced just before midnight sunday that turnout was 41.53%, or 8,089,320 people.the count was met with mockery and anger from members of the opposition, who said they believed between 2 million and 3 million people voted.julio borges, president of the opposition-led national assembly, said only 7% of the electorate had voted — a silent protest of maduro's power grab, which would slam the brakes on democracy.the opposition had urged voters to boycott the vote, but millions of venezuelans who hold government jobs were ordered to cast ballots or risk being fired.others feared loss of social benefits like subsidized food. “i’m here because i’m hoping for housing,” admitted hairdresser luisa marquez, 46, as she waited in line to vote.opinion polls had indicated that more than two-thirds of the nation opposed the president's move. the opposition said 7 million had voted against constitutional changes in a referendum it had organized a week ago.a midday check of 10 polling places here in the capital sunday showed most of them empty or nearly empty.“venezuela has screamed with its silence,” said borges, who put the day's death toll at 12. the public prosecutor's office confirmed nine deaths.maduro's vision of a new constitution to consolidate his power has drawn ire in washington. last week, the trump administration imposed sanctions on 13 senior venezuelan officials, and the white house and some u.s. lawmakers said stiffer sanctions could follow. mexico said it would support u.s. sanctions, and the organization of american states and the european parliament have also expressed support for the opposition.late sunday, the u.s. state department officially condemned the venezuelan government for holding the vote, saying maduro's bid to consolidate power would “undermine the venezuelan people’s right to self-determination.”u.n. ambassador nikki haley has called the vote a “sham election.”in venezuela, opposition leaders refused to put up candidates, arguing that the election has been structured to ensure that maduro’s ruling socialist party dominates. thus virtually all the more than 5,000 candidates for 545 assembly seats are maduro supporters.the opposition vowed to protest despite a ban on public gatherings issued by maduro. in some parts of the capital, people took to the streets in protest against the vote, but they were soon repelled by security forces throwing tear gas.during a protest, opposition supporters set an explosive that injured seven police officers, the public prosecutor's office said. after the blast, police set fire to four motorcycles belonging to journalists.read more:after months of fatal protests, venezuela braces for controversial vote sundaywhy this vote in venezuela is so importantmaduro has

that problem,\" she said.months of violence leading up to the vote showed little signs of ending, with media reporting that a leading assembly candidate and an opposition activist were killed before voting even began.josé felix pineda, a lawyer running in the election, was shot in his home saturday night, a senior venezuelan minister told the bbc.maduro has denied links to violent paramilitaries that have run roughshod across the country, blaming the opposition for unrelenting violence that has left more than 100 people dead.maduro himself voted with little fanfare early in the morning.“we’ve

the 1960s and was believed to be behind a string of deadly attacks in europe, including the paris bombing.canada’s justice minister signed an order in april 2012 to send diab to france after a

angle largely ignored by the state, flint said, which led to him being treated as a common criminal rather than as someone who needed additional consideration.\"individuals with autism have a difficult time understanding how other people feel, and have a difficult time processing their own feelings when they are bullied or made fun of or even when they interact normally with other people, they’re going to react differently, and it’s like none of that mattered,\" he said.\"he committed a crime, no doubt about that, but it seems like nobody’s noticing that he’s autistic and he needs

mobile phone and bullets during a search of his home.a receipt for christmas tree lights and surveillance footage showing him buying a pressure cooker from ikea were also part of the case.the 20-year-old, who grew up in the well-off suburb danderyd north of stockholm, denied the claims, but refused to explain why he bought the ingredients, which can be used to build bombs.\"my opinion is that he acquired, stored and collected liquids and objects to make and then blow up a suicide bomb in order to become a martyr.the criminal act being prepared could seriously have hurt sweden,\" prosecutor ewamari häggkvist said ahead of the verdict.attunda district court, north of stockholm, sentenced him to five years in jail on thursday morning for \"preparing to commit a terror crime\".it said it had reduced the sentence by one year because he is aged under 21.\"it is not clear what would have been the target of a bomb attack.but we believe that blowing up a shrapnel bomb of this kind would have been able to harm sweden and that the purpose of such a bomb must have been to instil fear in the way referred to by terrorism legislation,\" said the chairman of the court, mikael swahn, in a statement.sevigin's relatives had raised the alarm several months before he was arrested.in june last year one of his family members called the police, saying he was concerned about the 20-year-old, who had then disappeared.he was shortly thereafter stopped in turkey on two occasions.the first time he was made to return to greece, the second time he was flown back to sweden from

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0184", "doctext": "it’s possible that targeted killings will be the only policy of president barack obama that the new resident of the white house will be eager to perpetuate.last may, president donald trump stated, “i have to do what’s right … as far as drones are concerned … to take out terrorists”. he kept his word: us drones apparently killed three alleged al qaeda members in yemen in late january.targeted killing – the killing of specific individuals usually performed by drones – is a globally expanding practice.it blends police objectives with military operations. targets are considered to be enemy combatants. but if they were to be apprehended in the country where they plan to perpetrate their attack they would not be killed, they would be arrested and put on trial.targeted killings are a both a domestic issue and an international one and they combine resources gathered from intelligence means and military power. they are one of the constitutive elements of the preventive use of force framework that emerged in the early 2000s.killing by dronetargeted killings were introduced by israel just after the start of the second intifada in 2000; the idea came from the israeli internal security agency, shin bet. israel is unapologetic about these assassinations and ample information about the killings is available.the issue has been brought to the supreme court, which has repelled the accusation of illegality of the operations. it has also defined a set of restrictive criteria in order to regulate their use.back then, israel was criticised severely by the us, but that was two weeks before 9/11. once the us was hit, the bush administration started its own global program of targeted killings in the context of what became the doctrinal setting of the so-called “war on terror”.the global war on terror has often stirred criticism in france, both in civil society circles and in government. this should not come as a surprise since it is hard, if not impossible, to convince third parties that us law should authorise the violation of state sovereignty and that such unilateralism apply to the use of force.today, the uk has a programme of its own and france is also on board. french president françois hollande has set a “kill list” of jihadists who, his advisors believe, are a threat to french citizens. france, we knew, killed a jihadist in october 2015, but we now have information that this is not an isolated case.what we see today is the versatility of democracies and their selfishness. when leaders believe national security is not at risk, a discourse inspired by human rights prevails. when leaders believe there are security problems, especially if the lives of their civilians are at risk on their own soil, rights are not a primary concern. when abiding by principles is costly, they are put aside.this is the old “balancing” debate: the security versus rights dilemma. in theory it is a sophisticated one, the practice is less nuanced.prime minister manuel valls’s response to journalists who asked him if those operations were legal was telling. with a mix of candour, foolishness and arrogance, he responded that they ought not to ask questions that “are making things too complicated”.a global problemso far, the us program of targeted elimination is the most problematic. it can be argued that israel is in conflict with palestine and therefore the use of force is permissible in certain areas of the palestinian territories, as, in times of war and during conflicts, the killing of combatant by other combatants is legal and legitimate. this does not mean that israeli targeted killings program is immune to criticism and that what has become a routine is justifiable.but the us program authorises the us to kill its targets in countries it is not at war with or in the absence of conflict, in some cases these are even allies, such as pakistan where, for obvious reasons, they create great resentment.the area covered by the us program is huge and the number of operations very significant. unlike in the case of israel, no official data is available (especially concerning the number of civilians who die because of the attacks). the targets’ selection is also problematic, especially in the case of “signature strikes” – those targets that are selected on a statistical basis.the decision to strike depends on the signals that individuals display and which make them look suspicious. a young male dressed in clothes that cover his face, and taking a stroll at night in a pakistani area where rebels are known to live has good reasons to fear for his security.as the us will pursue if not expand its targeted killings policy, we need to be aware of the problems inherent to this practice. they are legally dubious. they create political tensions between those who use them and those states where they are operating.finally, their efficacy has not been proven. even, in the israeli case, some, very convincingly, challenge that targeted killings are the cause of the decrease of suicide bombers.who’s next, what’s next?other liberal countries are jumping on the bandwagon, such as the us’s gentle neighbour canada. but the next step is even more intriguing.for now, we see a clear north-south divide: western states are shooting while the middle east, africa and muslim areas are taking the bullets. but this might change.what will happen when russia, turkey and china launch their own operations? this will mark the end of western exceptionalism.in israel and in the us, democracies are engaged in vivid legal debates on the legality of the operations they carry out.the outcome of this endeavour has been to try to define domestic laws that would allow the use of force at the international level, which is already contrary to the spirit of international law (if not its content). at the international level, we saw some attempts to address this issue at the un, but, so far, the results of these efforts have been mitigated.what happens when non-democracies where human rights and international humanitarian laws, to say the least, are not a priority, use drones or other devices to perform targeted killings? it is probable that because they care less and have fewer resources and expertise than the us, their operations will be less precise?is their power likely to be contained? it is unlikely that the us and western states will be able to push in this direction. after all, they initiated the process. in this regard, the recent confrontation over syria between us ambassador samantha power and the russian representative vitaly churkin at the un in december 2016 is very telling about the general situation we are in.power repeatedly and emphatically asked the russians if they felt no “shame”, because of the heavy bombings they carried out in order to rescue and resuscitate the assad regime. in return, churkin mocked power by bluntly emphasising that she built “her statement as if she was mother teresa”. he told her to remember of her “own country track record”, instead of trying to display such unwarranted “moral supremacy”.we have to envisage the future consequences of the expansion of targeted killings as a norm and be aware of the dangers of their spread. it will be more difficult for those who want to occupy the moral high ground or simply to limit the use of force to denounce the absurdity of this situation. western elites in government and outside, by that time, will have already made too many concessions with the principles they want others to uphold.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "die", "Victim": [[["members", 353]]], "Place": [[["yemen", 364]]], "Killer": [[["us", 302]]], "MedicalIssue": []},

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0185", "doctext": "latest news straight to your inbox subscribe thank you for subscribing we have more newsletters show me see our privacy notice invalid emailthe second birmingham pub bombings pre-inquest review takes place this week. andy richards reveals for the first time the tragic story of young victim marilyn paula nash.an early riser for work, council worker john smith needed to be on autopilot as he set off as usual on the grey, dismal friday morning that is forever etched in his memory.normally, he would have had a spring in his step. after all, all the weekend was beckoning. it was a chance for him to unwind from the office graft, and perhaps enjoy a drink or two.but this wasn’t a normal morning. in fact, there had never been another morning quite like it in the west midlands.the previous night, well, at that stage all the terrible details were not known. accounts varied, the death toll was rising.bombers – everyone knew they were the ira, although the terror group had not claimed responsibility – had destroyed two pubs in birmingham city centre.nineteen people were dead, several were clinging to life, two of whom would eventually succumb to dreadful injuries.the number of injured seemed to change with almost every news bulletin, but it was steadily increasing, and by now it was more than 150.on the previous night – november 21, 1974 – families across the uk had clustered around tv sets and radios, utterly aghast and trying to take in what the news flashes from birmingham were showing and describing.in the city, and across the black country towns of west bromwich, dudley, walsall and wolverhampton, fear of more attacks, combined with growing anger, was visceral.there had already been a number of reprisal attacks on irish homes and businesses. the region bristled with tension.john’s head was already full of this as he fastened his coat to leave his walsall home. little did he know that the sickening horror of the previous night was on his own doorstep.he stepped out... and into a nightmare scenario.john, now a 74-year-old pensioner and still living in the same terraced property, knows the memories can never be erased.“it must have been about 7am,” he says. “we had all heard about the bombs going off in the pubs in birmingham the night before. the whole area was in shock, people could hardly believe it.”in his early 30s at the time, on that friday morning he was intent on catching his usual bus for the daily journey to work at lichfield council where he was involved in planning sewerage pipe developments.as he set off from the small close in pelsall where his family lived, he was confronted by the extraordinary sight of his neighbour, mr nash stumbling about in the road “like a lost man”.john remembers his neighbour’s tears and his face – the face of a man in absolute torment.“he was simply wandering about, not going anywhere but obviously really upset,” recalls john. “so naturally i went to him and asked him what was wrong.“he said his daughter, marilyn, had been in birmingham the night before. she still hadn’t come home.”mr nash was a widower and lived with marilyn, who was 22, and his son, robert, in the terraced house next door. john thinks robert was away studying at university at the time. either way, there was no-one else at home.with nobody to talk to, mr nash’s agony had multiplied with each long hour throughout the blackest of nights.“i tried to comfort him as best i could, but what can you do? what can you say?,” says john. “his daughter should have been home hours ago. there had been no sign or word of her.“i persuaded him to come back to our house where i left him with my mother before i went on to work. she did her best to help him.”whatever conversation passed between john’s mother and mr nash is not known. neither is how long the poor man waited for news.but his fears for his daughter were sadly well-founded. she never did come home.it took the authorities some time to confirm that birmingham shop worker marilyn paula nash – known as paula to her family and close friends – was among the dead.she was an attractive, vivacious young woman, with a hint of jackie onassis about her looks and hairstyle.those tasked with the dreadful job of identifying the dead could only confirm it was her by her wage packet, says john.“i remember that she was a very sweet, very friendly girl,” he recalls. “she was my next door neighbour and a reasonably similar age so, although were were not close, we would always say hello, and pass the time of day. sometimes we would catch the same bus if we were going into birmingham for a drink, and we would chat.”a fateful decision by marilyn to pop into a pub for a quick drink on the way home from work cost her her life.it was the penultimate pay day before christmas. the pubs in birmingham were full and business was brisk. marilyn headed for the tavern in the town, the underground bar in new street which had become a cult drinking hole for students and young workers.so did the bombers. they wrought carnage there, and at the nearby mulberry bush at the bottom of the rotunda.“when it became known that marilyn was among the dead, this whole area was in absolute shock,” remembers john. “there was a big irish community locally and a local catholic club was nearby.“i remember the police ordering the catholic club to be closed for security reasons for a time. i don’t think that was necessary, but i suppose they feared reprisals or trouble and had to be careful.”mr nash, who later remarried, is understood to have passed away many years ago, and marilyn’s brother is believed to live in another part of the country.john is probably the only resident from those days still living in the small, tidy street that witnessed such awful events.the homes there are well-kept but nowadays many have signs in their windows making it clear that callers without appointments are not welcome.it suggests the residents prefer keep themselves to themselves.most probably have no idea of the tragedy that visited the nash family 42 years ago.(image: wesley/keystone/getty images)as for john, his chat with me has clearly stirred recollections that have lay dormant for many years.but he is not optimistic that the new inquest will bring truth or closure to those who still grieve.“like a good many others i would like to know what really went on that night but...” and here he pauses.“it may turn something up, but those who did it have got away with it for too long.”ex-ira chief: pub attacks left me ashamed and appalled...(image: birmingham mail)the ira’s involvement in the bombings became clearer with the publication of the memoirs of kieran conway, head of the its intelligence-gathering department during the 1970s.in his book southside provisional, he confessed that the attacks on the pubs left him “ashamed and appalled.”the attacks on the birmingham pubs, neither of which had any military connection, “went against everything we claimed to stand for,” he said.the bombings came after police disrupted the funeral arrangements for james mcdade, a lieutenant in the birmingham brigade of the ira who blew himself up while trying to attack coventry telephone exchange a few days earlier.“tempers were high and i, for one, certainly at first feared that the local ira had knowingly caused these dreadful casualties,” said conway.he claimed the ira unit responsible “could not find a functioning telephone box, so they were unable to issue a warning sufficiently in time to clear the bars and prevent the mass loss of life.”conway finally left the republican movement in 1993 and is now a criminal lawyer in dublin.fighting families’ legal aid problems still to be resolvedrelatives of more than half the victims are hoping to be represented by lawyers at the pre-inquest review hearing on thursday.but at the time of going to press, longstanding issues of legal aid had still to be resolved.for several months the government had insisted that krw law, the belfast-based law firm representing most of the families, was not eligible for legal aid.but at the end of last month, there was a u-turn and the legal aid agency is currently considering a fresh application.legal aid minister sir oliver heald qc said: “it would be a travesty for families to be denied justice simply because of a technicality, which is why i have taken the decision to change the regulations around inquest funding. this will remove any barrier from the families’ solicitors in applying for legal aid funding for the inquest.”the inquest was re-opened in june last year following a campaign by the families, backed by the birmingham mail. the full inquest is expected to take place in september.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "detonate", "Attacker": [], "Target": [[["pub", 162]]], "Instrument": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Place": [[["birmingham", 151]]]},

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0187", "doctext": "manchester bomber’s blast felt on street where he grew upmanchester, england — the british-born jihadist behind the worst terror attack in britain in more than a decade in effect killed and maimed people he’d grown up with — making the atrocity even more horrifying for manchester residents still struggling to come to terms with a bombing that killed 22 people and injured 59 others at a concert of american pop star ariana grande.as the british government raised the terrorist threat level to \"critical\" — only the second time authorities have done so — details began to emerge of the 22-year-old suicide bomber salman abedi, his libyan paternity, and his alleged ties to a well-known recruiter for the islamic state terror group and other known jihadists.he only recently returned from a three-week trip to libya, according to family members. british police sources say the trip raises the possibility he may have met with members of the terror group’s affiliate in the north african country to plot the attack and to receive training.known to police the portrait drawn of the mass killer who packed his improvised explosive device with nails, nuts and bolts to maximize the slaughter, is a mixed one.some neighbors describe him as a football-obsessed fan of manchester united and keen enthusiast of computer games.they insist there were no signs the student dropout became radicalized. british security services acknowledged abedi was known to them — there are some reports the intelligence service may have tried to persuade him to act as an informant — but they did not see him as a high risk.others, though, describe a young man full of rage, who denounced a local mosque leader for his criticism of is. they say he started to pray openly in the streets.a police officer stands outside didsbury mosque in manchester, may 24, 2017.a local imam, mohammed saeed, told british newspapers abedi stopped attending his mosque in 2015 after they argued over is. “salman used to come to the mosque occasionally, he wasn’t particularly friendly towards me because he didn’t like my anti-is sermons. he didn’t like what i was saying and showed me the face of hate. he came to the mosque less and less after that.”son of libyan emigresabedi was born in manchester in 1994, the third of four children, three boys and one girl. his parents were libyan emigres who found a home in the northern english city after fleeing the moammar gadhafi regime in 1980.his father, ramadan abedi, a former security guard at manchester airport, returned to libya in 2011 to join the uprising against the libyan autocrat. since gadhafi’s overthrow his parents spent more time in the north african country than in their home in south manchester, less than two miles from the scene of monday’s bombing.police officers arrive at a residential property on elsmore road in fallowfield, manchester, on may 24, 2017, as investigations continue into the may 22 terror attack at the manchester arena.libyan emigres in manchester say the bomber’s father had no time for jihadist ideology. “he was always very confrontational with jihadi ideology, and this isis thing isn’t even jihad, it’s criminality. the family will be devastated,” one told local newspapers.according to the daily mirror newspaper, abedi was a family friend of raphael hostey, also known as abu qaqa al-britani, who helped recruit other young britons for islamic state via social media until he was killed in a drone strike in syria last year. british police sources say his ties to hostey are being probed by counter-terror officials who fear abedi may have been part of a terror cell, a concern heightened by a trip he made to libya in the run-up to the bombing.police also remain skeptical that abedi could have built the bomb alone because of its sophistication.radicalizationabedi attended local schools and then went on to study business and management at nearby salford university. in a statement, a university spokesman described him as \"completely off the radar. he turned up for lectures for two years and then just stopped coming.”a sign on the front door of a house reads \"stop knocking on this door - we know nothing about this family!!\" is pictured on elsmore road in fallowfield, manchester, on may 24, 2017.in the last year-and-half both abedi and his older brother, 23-year-old ismail, were active on social media sites, praising jihadists. police arrested ismail monday night hours after the blast. he taught arabic classes at the didsbury mosque and, according to locals, was reported to police after concerns were raised about what he was teaching.police are also probing the links between the abedi brothers and another british-libyan from manchester, abdalraouf abdallah, who was sentenced to a nine-year-prison term after being convicted of funding terrorism and preparing acts of terrorism.some analysts argue there were plenty of warning signs about abedi. in a recent study of young british jihadists for the henry jackson society, a london-based think tank, researcher emma webb noted a failure of various agencies and educational institutions to share relevant information about individuals vulnerable to radicalization.she urged police and social services to share “relevant information on vulnerable individuals so the full picture is known across all agencies.”", "templates": [{"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["people", 197]]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type":

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0189", "doctext": "questions have been raised in recent days about the political and religious beliefs of tamerlan tsarnaev, the boston marathon bombing suspect killed in a gunfight with police in the early hours of friday.anecdotes suggest that tamerlan became more religious in the last several years and may have embraced more conservative islamic ideas, although no link has been established between him and any known terrorist group.on monday, a spokesman for the islamic society of boston, a cambridge mosque frequented by tamerlan, contributed to the emerging debate over the suspect’s religious beliefs by sharing an anecdote from a january talk at the mosque, during which tamerlan disrupted the event and insulted the speaker, accusing him of deviating from islam by comparing the prophet muhammad to martin luther king jr.it was the second time that tamerlan disrupted an event at the mosque because he felt that its religious message was too liberal, said the spokesman, yusufi vali, according to a report in the boston globe.in disrupting the talk in january at the islamic society of boston mosque in cambridge, tamerlan tsarnaev’s shouted at a speaker: “you are a kafir” — a nonbeliever, according to yusufi vali, a spokesman for the mosque.tsarnaev went on to say the speaker was contaminating people’s minds and accused him of being a hypocrite.the congregation disagreed, according to vali, and “shouted him out of the mosque” on prospect street.tsarnaev also interrupted a talk last november when a speaker said it was fine for people to celebrate holidays such as thanksgiving and july 4, in the same way you celebrate the birthday of the prophet.tsarnaev challenged him and the two talked after service.“the brother was angry, but he left,’’ vali said.the islamic society of boston issued a news release on monday afternoon detailing the organization’s interactions with the suspects, who it said were “neither members nor regular attendees” of religious services there.the statement focused almost exclusively on tamerlan, who the organization said had begun coming “intermittently” to weekly friday prayers and “occasionally” to daily services about a year ago.it said dzhokhar “was rarely seen at the center, coming only occasionally for prayer.”the statement included lengthy descriptions of the incidents in january and november when tamerlan disrupted events at the mosque, leading the community there to reprimand and ostracize him.on november 16, 2012, at our weekly congregational prayer, one of our preachers sermonized that it was appropriate to celebrate national holidays like july 4th and thanksgiving, just like the birthday of the prophet (peace be upon him).the older suspect stood up during the sermon and challenged the preacher, arguing that celebration of any holiday was not allowed in the faith.after the sermon ended and the congregational prayer was finished, the preacher met with the older suspect to share his opinion.the suspect repeatedly argued his viewpoint, and then left.on january 18, 2013, one of our preachers noted that dr. martin luther king jr. was a great person remembered in history.the older suspect stood up, shouted and called him a “nonbeliever”; said that he was “contaminating people’s minds”; and began calling him a hypocrite.people of the congregation, in turn, shouted back at the older suspect, “leave now!” due to the congregation’s disapproval, he left the sermon.after the sermon and the congregational prayer ended, a few volunteer leaders of the mosque sat down with the older suspect and gave him a clear choice: either he stops interrupting sermons and remains silent or he would not be welcomed.while he continued to attend some of the congregational prayers after the january incident, he neither interrupted another sermon nor did he cause any other disturbances.the statement said that no member of the mosque’s board or staff “ever interacted” with either dzhokhar or tamerlan, who it said “disagreed with the moderate american-islamic theology of the i.s.b.cambridge mosque.”“our mosque is one filled with attendees who are teachers, businessmen, doctors and lawyers, all of whom are committed to the public good,” the statement said.“while these suspects did express views counter to our mosque’s philosophy, they never expressed any hint of violent sentiments or behavior.if they had, the f.b.i.would have immediately been called.”on saturday, the mosque posted a long note on its front door, which was photographed and uploaded to twitter by several people, including steve annear, a freelance journalist and contributor to boston magazine.here is the note about the bombing suspects on the door of the islamic society of boston.they were guest s there.//t.co/vdv1zwxagi — steve annear (@steveannear) 21 apr 13the note expressed shock and sadness at the bombing of the boston marathon and urged members of the congregation to contact the f.b.i.with any information they may have about the tsarnaev brothers.the statement was also posted on the mosque’s web site.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "die", "Victim": [[["suspect", 134]], [["tamerlan tsarnaev", 87]]], "Place": [[["boston marathon", 110]]], "Killer": [[["police", 168]]], "MedicalIssue": []}, {"incident_type": "contact", "Participant": [[["spokesman", 432]]], "Topic": [[["suspect", 134]], [["beliefs", 76]]], "Place": [[["cambridge", 479]]]}, {"incident_type": "correspondence", "Participant": [[["speaker", 709]], [["tsarnaev", 96]]], "Instrument": [], "Topic": [[["prophet", 772]]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "broadcast", "Communicator": [[["islamic society of boston", 450]]], "Recipient": [], "Instrument": [], "Topic": [[["organization", 1840]], [["suspects", 1877]]], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "broadcast", "Communicator": [[["mosque", 489]]], "Recipient": [[["steve annear", 4540]]], "Instrument": [], "Topic": [[["note", 3049]]], "Place": []}]}
{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0190", "doctext": "had his homemade bomb gone off—one he had diabolically constructed using shrapnel coated with a substance meant to keep blood from clotting in wounds—kevin harpham would have undoubtedly caused the death and injury of many people at last year’s martin luther king, jr. day unity march in spokane, washington.instead, harpham was eventually caught and recently sentenced to 32 years in prison for a hate crime and other offenses related to the attempted bombing. the case illustrates how a quick response by citizens and local law enforcement averted a tragedy and how teamwork and time-tested investigative techniques led to the apprehension of an individual who has shown no remorse for his actions.“clearly he intended to detonate the device, cause mass carnage, and then survey the devastation,” said special agent frank harrill, who supervised the investigation. “harpham was acting out against what he termed multiculturalism, but his hatred was firmly rooted in violent white supremacy. this was a prototypical hate crime.”on january 17, 2011, as hundreds of people gathered in downtown spokane to participate in the march, harpham placed his backpack bomb along the parade route at washington street and main avenue. alert city workers discovered the suspicious backpack before the march started, and spokane police department officials changed the route as a precaution. the spokane police and sheriff’s office bomb squad was called in, and their precision in disarming the device enabled evidence to be preserved that would help lead fbi agents to harpham.the fbi’s joint terrorism task force (jttf) in spokane immediately began an investigation, and jttf members canvassed the region for batteries and other components similar to those used in the bomb. within a month, in a small town about 60 miles north of spokane, they discovered that a local outlet of a large retail chain was selling the same kind of fishing weights harpham had used as shrapnel.store records showed there had been three large purchases of the weights in recent months—two were paid for in cash, but a debit card was used in one transaction, and it belonged to harpham. at the same time, the fbi laboratory had been working to extract a dna sample from the backpack that was later matched to harpham through his military records.investigators also learned of harpham’s white supremacy postings on the internet and his affiliation with a neo-nazi group called the national alliance.because he lived in a remote, relatively inaccessible area and was likely heavily armed, our hostage rescue team devised a ruse to lure harpham out of his house. he was arrested march 9, 2011 without incident—but as agents suspected, he was armed when taken into custody.“kevin harpham was the lone wolf that all of us in law enforcement dread,” harrill said. “he lived alone, he worked alone, and he didn’t foreshadow the bombing plot in any meaningful way. he targeted those who were attempting to celebrate an event meant to unite society,” harrill added, “and he was prepared to indiscriminately kill men, women, and children.”harrill credited teamwork and strong partnerships for stopping harpham and bringing him to justice. “from the workers who noticed the device to the police response, the jttf investigation, the expertise of the fbi laboratory, and the prosecuting skill of the u.s. attorney’s office—everything worked just as it should have.”resources:- washington man sentenced to 32 years (12/20/2011)- attempted bomber pleads guilty

cnn said in their report they were told that the drones used in the attack were dismantled, taken over the border from columbia to venezuela, and reassembled there.contacted, dji could not definitively confirm that some of its drones appear in the footage aired by cnn, although that appears to be the case.a spokesman for dji, adam lisberg, sent the following statement to the c-drone review:dji makes drones entirely for peaceful purposes, and we absolutely deplore any attempt to use our drones to cause harm.we build safety features into our products to help drone pilots avoid flying in restricted areas, and we developed our aeroscope system to allow authorities to remotely identify and track airborne drones.we have little ability to control what people do with our products after purchase, but anyone who deliberately misuses our products should expect to be held responsible for their actions.venezuela is in crisis, with widespread shortages of staple foodstuffs and medical supplies, rolling power outages, and thousands of inhabitants leaving the country every day.president maduro has accused columbia and the united states of conspiring against him, without proof.the us withdrew its last embassy personnel from venezuela last week, as opposition politician juan guaidó seeks to oust maduro from power.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "meet", "Participant": [[["cnn", 0]], [["man", 15]]], "Topic": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "broadcast", "Communicator": [[["cnn", 0]]], "Recipient": [], "Instrument": [], "Topic": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "manufacture", "ManufacturerAssembler": [], "Artifact": [[["matrice m600 pro", 138]]], "Components": [[["a3 pro positioning system", 173]]], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "broadcast", "Communicator": [[["cnn", 0]]], "Recipient": [], "Instrument": [], "Topic": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "meet", "Participant": [[["cnn", 0]], [["man", 15]]], "Topic": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "injure", "Victim": [[["people", 549]]], "Injurer": [], "Instrument": [], "BodyPart": [], "MedicalCondition": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "manufacture", "ManufacturerAssembler": [], "Artifact": [], "Components": [[["matrice m600 pro c-drones", 926]]], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "manufacture", "ManufacturerAssembler": [], "Artifact": [[["drones", 536]]], "Components": [[["explosive charge", 1002]]], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "dismantle", "Dismantler": [], "Artifact": [[["the drones used in the attack", 2114]]], "Instrument": [], "Components": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "manufacture", "ManufacturerAssembler": [], "Artifact": [[["the drones used in the attack", 2114]]], "Components": [], "Instrument": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "meet", "Participant": [[["he", 170]], [["officials", 1535]]], "Topic": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "transport", "Transporter": [], "PassengerArtifact": [], "Vehicle": [[["phantom quadcopter drones", 1198]]], "Origin": [], "Destination": []}, {"incident_type": "attack", "Attacker": [[["man", 15]]], "Target": [[["nicolás maduro", 510]]], "Instrument": [[["drones", 536]]], "Place": [[["caracas", 266]]]}, {"incident_type": "arrest", "Jailer": [], "Detainee": [[["suspects", 668]]], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "identify", "Identifier": [], "IdentifiedObject": [[["three-sensor system", 1974]]], "IdentifiedRole": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "charge", "Prosecutor": [], "Defendant": [[["columbia", 842]]], "JudgeCourt": [], "Crime": [], "Place": []}, {"incident_type": "evacuation", "Transporter": [], "PassengerArtifact": [[["personnel", 3732]]], "Vehicle": [], "Origin": [], "Destination": []}, {"incident_type": "identify", "Identifier": [[["the man interviewed", 1450]]], "IdentifiedObject": [], "IdentifiedRole": [], "Place": []}]}

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0194", "doctext": "a report by the united nations human rights council has called for independent investigations to be carried out into drone attacks after a series of strikes that result in unexpected civilian deaths in afghanistan, pakistan, yemen and elsewhere. most of the attacks involved us drones.in a 21-page report, the un special rapporteur on human rights, ben emmerson, records a dramatic reduction in drone strikes in 2013 in pakistan but increases in afghanistan and, towards the end of the year, in yemen.the decline in drone strikes in pakistan comes after its government's repeated calls for the us to reduce their number. islamabad argued that the impact of drone strikes was counterproductive, turned opinion in the country against the us and undermined the pakistani government.but emmerson noted a threefold increase in recorded civilian casualties from drone strikes in afghanistan in 2013. he concluded that states have an obligation to launch inquiries into cases in which civilians become caught up.his report said: \"having regard to the duty of states to protect civilians in armed conflict, the special rapporteur concluded that in any case in which there have been, or appear to have been, civilian casualties that were not anticipated when the attack was planned, the state responsible is under an obligation to conduct a prompt, independent and impartial fact-finding inquiry and to provide a detailed public explanation of the results.\"this obligation would be triggered whenever there is a plausible indication from any apparently reliable source that unintended civilian casualties may have been sustained.\"the proposal is likely to form the basis for a draft resolution to be debated by the unhrc in geneva, switzerland.emmerson devoted a large part of the report to listing specific drone strikes involving civilians. he said he had identified 30 attacks out of a total of 37 brought to his attention in which civilians had been killed, suffered life-threatening injuries or been put at risk.in afghanistan, emmerson, who travelled widely for the report, said that up to the end of 2012 drone strikes \"appeared to have inflicted significantly lower levels of civilians casualties than aerial attacks carried out by other air platforms. this is no longer the position.\"in 2013, drone attacks accounted for 40% of the total number of civilian fatalities from air strikes. there were 45 civilian fatalities and 14 non-fatal injuries, a threefold increase compared with 2012.in pakistan, he recorded \"a marked drop\" in civilian casualties since 2012. \"figures to the end of 2013 confirm that there has been a significant de-escalation in the number of recorded drone strikes in pakistan,\" he said. strikes were down to 27 in 2013 from a peak of 128 in 2010, and for the first time in nine years there had been no civilian casualties reported.\"at the time of writing, there have been no reported drone strikes during 2014, the longest pause since president obama took office,\" emmerson said.the bureau of investigative journalism, which monitors media reports on drones strikes, reported last month that there had been no known drone strikes in pakistan since 25 december. us officials say the lull was a response to requests by the pakistani government, which has been trying to launch peace talks with the pakistani taliban.in yemen, emmerson was told that the us routinely sought prior consent for attacks, although human rights watch has quoted the yemeni government as saying they were not pre-approved.in israel, he said the government stressed it aimed for zero civilian casualties, saying it provided advance warning of attacks where possible. but emmerson \"identified a number of sample strikes in which there are credible allegations that civilians were killed or injured as the result of israeli drone strikes in gaza\".kat craig, legal director of reprieve, the legal charity which has been campaigning on the issue, said: \"in yemen, pakistan and elsewhere, the us, assisted by its european allies, is carrying out devastating attacks with total impunity – a practice that is terrorising local communities, and creating far more extremism than it has ever eliminated.\"it is high time that the us provided full accountability and transparency around its use of drones, and investigated civilian casualties. this report will only increase pressure on the us to bring their covert programme out of the shadows.\"", "templates":

{"docid": "TRAIN1-WIKI-0197", "doctext": "despite president barack obama’s recent call to reduce the united states’ reliance on drones, they will likely remain his administration’s weapon of choice. whereas president george w. bush oversaw fewer than 50 drone strikes during his tenure, obama has signed off on over 400 of them in the last four years, making the program the centerpiece of u.s. counterterrorism strategy. the drones have done their job remarkably well: by killing key leaders and denying terrorists sanctuaries in pakistan, yemen, and, to a lesser degree, somalia, drones have devastated al qaeda and associated anti-american militant groups. and they have done so at little financial cost, at no risk to u.s. forces, and with fewer civilian casualties than many alternative methods would have caused.critics, however, remain skeptical. they claim that drones kill thousands of innocent civilians, alienate allied governments, anger foreign publics, illegally target americans, and set a dangerous precedent that irresponsible governments will abuse. some of these criticisms are valid; others, less so. in the end, drone strikes remain a necessary instrument of counterterrorism. the united states simply cannot tolerate terrorist safe havens in remote parts of pakistan and elsewhere, and drones offer a comparatively low-risk way of targeting these areas while minimizing collateral damage.so drone warfare is here to stay, and it is likely to expand in the years to come as other countries’ capabilities catch up with those of the united states. but washington must continue to improve its drone policy, spelling out clearer rules for extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings so that tyrannical regimes will have a harder time pointing to the u.s. drone program to justify attacks against political opponents. at the same time, even as it solidifies the drone program, washington must remain mindful of the built-in limits of low-cost, unmanned interventions, since the very convenience of drone warfare risks dragging the united states into conflicts it could otherwise avoid.nobody does it betterthe obama administration relies on drones for one simple reason: they work. according to data compiled by the new america foundation, since obama has been in the white house, u.s. drones have killed an estimated 3,300 al qaeda, taliban, and other jihadist operatives in pakistan and yemen. that number includes over 50 senior leaders of al qaeda and the taliban—top figures who are not easily replaced. in 2010, osama bin laden warned his chief aide, atiyah abd al-rahman, who was later killed by a drone strike in the waziristan region of pakistan in 2011, that when experienced leaders are eliminated, the result is “the rise of lower leaders who are not as experienced as the former leaders” and who are prone to errors and miscalculations. and drones also hurt terrorist organizations when they eliminate operatives who are lower down on the food chain but who boast special skills: passport forgers, bomb makers, recruiters, and fundraisers.drones have also undercut terrorists’ ability to communicate and to train new recruits. in order to avoid attracting drones, al qaeda and taliban operatives try to avoid using electronic devices or gathering in large numbers. a tip sheet found among jihadists in mali advised militants to “maintain complete silence of all wireless contacts” and “avoid gathering in open areas.” leaders, however, cannot give orders when they are incommunicado, and training on a large scale is nearly impossible when a drone strike could wipe out an entire group of new recruits. drones have turned al qaeda’s command and training structures into a liability, forcing the group to choose between having no leaders and risking dead leaders.critics of drone strikes often fail to take into account the fact that the alternatives are either too risky or unrealistic. to be sure, in an ideal world, militants would be captured alive, allowing authorities to question them and search their compounds for useful information. raids, arrests, and interrogations can produce vital intelligence and can be less controversial than lethal operations. that is why they should be, and indeed already are, used in stable countries where the united states enjoys the support of the host government. but in war zones or unstable countries, such as pakistan, yemen, and somalia, arresting militants is highly dangerous and, even if successful, often inefficient. in those three countries, the government exerts little or no control over remote areas, which means that it is highly dangerous to go after militants hiding out there. worse yet, in pakistan and yemen, the governments have at times cooperated with militants. if the united states regularly sent in special operations forces to hunt down terrorists there, sympathetic officials could easily tip off the jihadists, likely leading to firefights, u.s. casualties, and possibly the deaths of the suspects and innocent civilians.of course, it was a navy seal team and not a drone strike that finally got bin laden, but in many cases in which the united states needs to capture or eliminate an enemy, raids are too risky and costly. and even if a raid results in a successful capture, it begets another problem: what to do with the detainee. prosecuting detainees in a federal or military court is difficult because often the intelligence against terrorists is inadmissible or using it risks jeopardizing sources and methods. and given the fact that the united states is trying to close, rather than expand, the detention facility at guantánamo bay, cuba, it has become much harder to justify holding suspects indefinitely. it has become more politically palatable for the united states to kill rather than detain suspected terrorists.furthermore, although a drone strike may violate the local state’s sovereignty, it does so to a lesser degree than would putting u.s. boots on the ground or conducting a large-scale air campaign. and compared with a 500-pound bomb dropped from an f-16, the grenadelike warheads carried by most drones create smaller, more precise blast zones that decrease the risk of unexpected structural damage and casualties. even more important, drones, unlike traditional airplanes, can loiter above a target for hours, waiting for the ideal moment to strike and thus reducing the odds that civilians will be caught in the kill zone.finally, using drones is also far less bloody than asking allies to hunt down terrorists on the united states’ behalf. the pakistani and yemeni militaries, for example, are known to regularly torture and execute detainees, and they often indiscriminately bomb civilian areas or use scorched-earth tactics against militant groups.some critics of the drone program, such as ben emmerson, the un’s special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, have questioned the lethal approach, arguing for more focus on the factors that might contribute to extremism and terrorism, such as poverty, unemployment, and authoritarianism. such a strategy is appealing in principle, but it is far from clear how washington could execute it. individuals join anti-american terrorist groups for many reasons, ranging from outrage over u.s. support for israel to anger at their own government’s cooperation with the united states. some people simply join up because their neighbors are doing so. slashing unemployment in yemen, bringing democracy to saudi arabia, and building a functioning government in somalia are laudable goals, but they are not politically or financially possible for the united states, and even if achieved, they still might not reduce the allure of jihad.in some cases, the most sensible alternative to carrying out drone strikes is to do nothing at all. at times, that is the right option: if militants abroad pose little threat or if the risk of killing civilians, delegitimizing allies, or establishing the wrong precedent is too high. but sometimes imminent and intolerable threats do arise and drone strikes are the best way to eliminate them.the numbers gamedespite the obvious benefits of using drones and the problems associated with the alternatives, numerous critics argue that drones still have too many disadvantages. first among them is an unacceptably high level of civilian casualties. admittedly, drones have killed innocents. but the real debate is over how many and whether alternative approaches are any better. the bureau of investigative journalism reports that in 2011, drone strikes killed as many as 146 noncombatants, including as many as 9 children. columbia law school’s human rights clinic also cites high numbers of civilian deaths, as does the pakistani organization pakistan body count. peter bergen of the new america foundation oversees a database of drone casualties culled from u.s. sources and international media reports. he estimates that between 150 and 500 civilians have been killed by drones during obama’s administration. u.s. officials, meanwhile, maintain that drone strikes have killed almost no civilians. in june 2011, john brennan, then obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, even contended that u.s. drone strikes had killed no civilians in the previous year. but these claims are based on the fact that the u.s. government assumes that all military-age males in the blast area of a drone strike are combatants— unless it can determine after the fact that they were innocent (and such intelligence gathering is not a priority).the united states has recently taken to launching “signature strikes,” which target not specific individuals but instead groups engaged in suspicious activities. this approach makes it even more difficult to distinguish between combatants and civilians and verify body counts of each. still, as one u.s. official told the new york times last year, “al qaeda is an insular, paranoid organization—innocent neighbors don’t hitchhike rides in the back of trucks headed for the border with guns and bombs.” of course, not everyone accepts this reasoning. zeeshan-ul-hassan usmani, who runs pakistan body count, says that “neither [the united states] nor pakistan releases any detailed information about the victims . . . so [although the united states] likes to call everybody taliban, i call everybody civilians.”the truth is that all the public numbers are unreliable. who constitutes a civilian is often unclear; when trying to kill the pakistani taliban leader baitullah mehsud, for example, the united states also killed his doctor. the doctor was not targeting u.s. or allied forces, but he was aiding a known terrorist leader. in addition, most strikes are carried out in such remote locations that it is nearly impossible for independent sources to verify who was killed. in pakistan, for example, the overwhelming majority of drone killings occur in tribal areas that lie outside the government’s control and are prohibitively dangerous for westerners and independent local journalists to enter. thus, although the new america foundation has come under fire for relying heavily on unverifiable information provided by anonymous u.s. officials, reports from local pakistani organizations, and the western organizations that rely on them, are no better: their numbers are frequently doctored by the pakistani government or by militant groups. after a strike in pakistan, militants often cordon off the area, remove their dead, and admit only local reporters sympathetic to their cause or decide on a body count themselves. the u.s. media often then draw on such faulty reporting to give the illusion of having used multiple sources. as a result, statistics on civilians killed by drones are often inflated. one of the few truly independent on-the-ground reporting efforts, conducted by the associated press last year, concluded that the strikes “are killing far fewer civilians than many in [pakistan] are led to believe.”but even the most unfavorable estimates of drone casualties reveal that the ratio of civilian to militant deaths—about one to three, according to the bureau of investigative journalism—is lower than it would be for other forms of strikes. bombings by f-16s or tomahawk cruise missile salvos, for example, pack a much more deadly payload. in december 2009, the united states fired tomahawks at a suspected terrorist training camp in yemen, and over 30 people were killed in the blast, most of them women and children. at the time, the yemeni regime refused to allow the use of drones, but had this not been the case, a drone’s real-time surveillance would probably have spotted the large number of women and children, and the attack would have been aborted. even if the strike had gone forward for some reason, the drone’s far smaller warhead would have killed fewer innocents. civilian deaths are tragic and pose political problems. but the data show that drones are more discriminate than other types of force.foreign friendsit is also telling that drones have earned the backing, albeit secret, of foreign governments. in order to maintain popular support, politicians in pakistan and yemen routinely rail against the u.s. drone campaign. in reality, however, the governments of both countries have supported it. during the bush and obama administrations, pakistan has even periodically hosted u.s. drone facilities and has been told about strikes in advance. pervez musharraf, president of pakistan until 2008, was not worried about the drone program’s negative publicity: “in pakistan, things fall out of the sky all the time,” he reportedly remarked. yemen’s former president, ali abdullah saleh, also at times allowed drone strikes in his country and even covered for them by telling the public that they were conducted by the yemeni air force. when the united states’ involvement was leaked in 2002, however, relations between the two countries soured. still, saleh later let the drone program resume in yemen, and his replacement, abdu rabbu mansour hadi, has publicly praised drones, saying that “they pinpoint the target and have zero margin of error, if you know what target you’re aiming at.”as officials in both pakistan and yemen realize, u.s. drone strikes help their governments by targeting common enemies. a memo released by the antisecrecy website wikileaks revealed that pakistan’s army chief, ashfaq parvez kayani, privately asked u.s. military leaders in 2008 for “continuous predator coverage” over antigovernment militants, and the journalist mark mazzetti has reported that the united states has conducted “goodwill kills” against pakistani militants who threatened pakistan far more than the united states. thus, in private, pakistan supports the drone program. as then prime minister yousaf raza gilani told anne patterson, then the u.s. ambassador to pakistan, in 2008, “we’ll protest [against the drone program] in the national assembly and then ignore it.”still, pakistan is reluctant to make its approval public. first of all, the country’s inability to fight terrorists on its own soil is a humiliation for pakistan’s politically powerful armed forces and intelligence service. in addition, although drones kill some of the government’s enemies, they have also targeted pro-government groups that are hostile to the united states, such as the haqqani network and the taliban, which pakistan has supported since its birth in the early 1990s. even more important, the pakistani public is vehemently opposed to u.s. drone strikes.a 2012 poll found that 74 percent of pakistanis viewed the united states as their enemy, likely in part because of the ongoing drone campaign. similarly, in yemen, as the scholar gregory johnsen has pointed out, drone strikes can win the enmity of entire tribes. this has led critics to argue that the drone program is shortsighted: that it kills today’s enemies but creates tomorrow’s in the process.such concerns are valid, but the level of local anger over drones is often lower than commonly portrayed. many surveys of public opinion related to drones are conducted by anti-drone organizations, which results in biased samples. other surveys exclude those who are unaware of the drone program and thus overstate the importance of those who are angered by it. in addition, many pakistanis do not realize that the drones often target the very militants who are wreaking havoc on their country. and for most pakistanis and yemenis, the most important problems they struggle with are corruption, weak representative institutions, and poor economic growth; the drone program is only a small part of their overall anger, most of which is directed toward their own governments. a poll conducted in 2007, well before the drone campaign had expanded to its current scope, found that only 15 percent of pakistanis had a favorable opinion of the united states. it is hard to imagine that alternatives to drone strikes, such as seal team raids or cruise missile strikes, would make the united states more popular.the home frontstill, public opposition is real, and there is growing concern about the drone strikes even in the united states. the program came under especially heavy criticism domestically in 2011, when anwar al-awlaki, a u.s. citizen born in new mexico, was killed by a drone strike in yemen. there is no question that awlaki was dangerous. adept at interspersing islamist rhetoric with pop-culture references, awlaki had been described as a “pied piper for western ears”: one admirer was nidal malik hasan, the u.s. army officer who killed 13 u.s. soldiers at fort hood, texas, in 2009.the obama administration claims that awlaki was actively involved in plots against the united states and that the strike against him was legal under the authorization for the use of military force (aumf), which congress passed three days after 9/11 and which gives the president broad authority to use force against terrorist groups linked to the 9/11 attacks. yet with the war on terrorism almost 12 years old and bin laden dead, critics, such as the georgetown university law professor rosa brooks, have begun questioning whether the aumf still justifies drone strikes today. as brooks has argued, “many of the groups now being identified as threats don’t fall clearly under the aumf’s umbrella—and many don’t pose a significant danger to the united states.” as for the case of awlaki, opponents of his killing have argued that he did not pose an imminent threat to the united states and that in keeping the evidence used to justify his assassination secret, the administration violated the constitutional guarantee of due process for u.s. citizens. as ron paul, then a texas representative, pointed out during his presidential campaign, awlaki was never charged with any crime. he added, “if the american people accept this blindly and casually, that we now have an accepted practice of the president assassinating people who he thinks are bad guys, i think it’s sad.”the administration contends that the discussions held within the executive branch and the extensive vetting of evidence constitute a form of due process. meanwhile, as the legal scholar benjamin wittes has pointed out, both congress and the federal courts have repeatedly reaffirmed the validity of the aumf since 2001. the u.s. government argues that given how secretly terrorists operate, it is not always possible to use other means to stop an individual overseas from planning attacks on u.s. forces or allies. as a result, the imminence of a threat should be assessed based on the individual’s propensity for violence and the likelihood of being able to stop him in the future. wittes compares the decision-making process to that used in hostage situations, when police are not required to ask a judge for authority to kill a hostage taker or refrain from taking a clear shot if they have one. perhaps most important, the white house has claimed only a very limited right to conduct drone strikes against u.s. citizens. the administration has asserted the authority to kill only senior al qaeda leaders who cannot be captured, not any american member of al qaeda. indeed, it appears that awlaki is the only u.s. citizen who has been deliberately killed by a drone.?follow the leaderthe fact remains that by using drones so much, washington risks setting a troublesome precedent with regard to extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings. zeke johnson of amnesty international contends that “when the u.s. government violates international law, that sets a precedent and provides an excuse for the rest of the world to do the same.” and it is alarming to think what leaders such as syrian president bashar al-assad, who has used deadly force against peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators he has deemed terrorists, would do with drones of their own. similarly, iran could mockingly cite the u.s. precedent to justify sending drones after rebels in syria. even brennan has conceded that the administration is “establishing precedents that other nations may follow.”controlling the spread of drone technology will prove impossible; that horse left the barn years ago. drones are highly capable weapons that are easy to produce, and so there is no chance that washington can stop other militaries from acquiring and using them. nearly 90 other countries already have surveillance drones in their arsenals, and china is producing several inexpensive models for export. armed drones are more difficult to produce and deploy, but they, too, will likely spread rapidly. beijing even recently announced (although later denied) that it had considered sending a drone to myanmar (also called burma) to kill a wanted drug trafficker hiding there.the spread of drones cannot be stopped, but the united states can still influence how they are used. the coming proliferation means that washington needs to set forth a clear policy now on extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings of terrorists—and stick to it. fortunately, obama has begun to discuss what constitutes a legitimate drone strike. but the definition remains murky, and this murkiness will undermine the president’s ability to denounce other countries’ behavior should they start using drones or other means to hunt down enemies. by keeping its policy secret, washington also makes it easier for critics to claim that the united states is wantonly slaughtering innocents. more transparency would make it harder for countries such as pakistan to make outlandish claims about what the united states is doing. drones actually protect many pakistanis, and washington should emphasize this fact. by being more open, the administration could also show that it carefully considers the law and the risks to civilians before ordering a strike.washington needs to be especially open about its use of signature strikes. according to the obama administration, signature strikes have eliminated not only low-level al qaeda and taliban figures but also a surprising number of higher-level officials whose presence at the scenes of the strikes was unexpected. signature strikes are in keeping with traditional military practice; for the most part, u.s. soldiers have been trained to strike enemies at large, such as german soldiers or vietcong guerrillas, and not specific individuals. the rise of unconventional warfare, however, has made this usual strategy more difficult because the battlefield is no longer clearly defined and enemies no longer wear identifiable uniforms, making combatants harder to distinguish from civilians. in the case of drones, where there is little on-the-ground knowledge of who is who, signature strikes raise legitimate concerns, especially because the obama administration has not made clear what its rules and procedures for such strikes are.washington should exercise particular care with regard to signature strikes because mistakes risk tarnishing the entire drone program. in the absence of other information, the argument that drones are wantonly killing innocents is gaining traction in the united states and abroad. more transparency could help calm these fears that washington is acting recklessly.the u.s. government also needs to guard against another kind of danger: that the relative ease of using drones will make u.s. intervention abroad too common. the scholars daniel brunstetter and megan braun have argued that drones provide “a way to avoid deploying troops or conducting an intensive bombing campaign” and that this “may encourage countries to act on just cause with an ease that is potentially worrisome.” although al qaeda remains a threat, it has been substantially defanged since 9/11, thanks to the destruction of its haven in afghanistan and effective global police, intelligence, and drone campaigns against its cells. in addition, the u.s. government needs to remember that many of the world’s jihadist organizations are focused first and foremost on local regimes and that although the united states has an interest in helping its allies fight extremists, washington cannot and should not directly involve itself in every fight. the obama administration should spell out those cases in which the aumf does not apply and recognize the risks of carrying out so-called goodwill kills on behalf of foreign governments. helping french and malian forces defeat jihadists in mali by providing logistical support, for example, is smart policy, but sending u.s. drones there is not.in places where terrorists are actively plotting against the united states, however, drones give washington the ability to limit its military commitments abroad while keeping americans safe. afghanistan, for example, could again become a taliban-run haven for terrorists after u.s. forces depart next year. drones can greatly reduce the risk of this happening. hovering in the skies above, they can keep taliban leaders on the run and hinder al qaeda’s ability to plot another 9/11.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "die", "Victim": [[["civilians", 862]]], "Place": [], "Killer": [], "MedicalIssue":

commemoration of the 15 people who died and 16 who were seriously injured in the mcgurk's bar bombing of 1971. relatives of the victims, who held a memorial service in belfast this week, are calling for an investigation into allegations of crown force collusion in the uvf bomb attack.thirty years ago this week, on 4 december 1971, a uvf gang placed a bomb in the hallway of mcgurk's bar in north queens street. amongst the dead, which included children and pensioners, were several members of the bar owner, patrick mcgurk's family, who were upstairs in the living area at the time of the explosion. the building collapsed, trapping many of the victims under the rubble.alex mclaughlin, whose father was killed in the attack, said there was a massive crown force presence in the area in the week prior to the bombing in contrast to the night of the atttack.\"two days earlier, three men had escaped from crumlin road jail and the ruc had swamped the area looking for them,\" said alex. \"it seems strange that loyalists would choose that time to drive from tigers bay into a catholic area to plant a bomb.\"despite an eyewitness account identifying the bombing crew and the fact that the bombing was claimed by loyalists in the immediate aftrermath of the attack, the british authorities blamed the ira.journalists were briefed by senior members of the british army, who claimed forensic evidence confirmed republicans were responsible for the explosion.in her study, \"ireland: the propaganda war,\" liz curtis describes how the british army and ruc, with the assistance of much of the press, successfully diverted attention from the evidence of loyalist involvement and used the atrocity to discredit their principle enemy, the ira.\"the mcgurk's bar bombing had caused more casualties than any single previous incident,\" said curtis, \"loyalists were responsible but never stood publicly condemned for it beyond nationalist areas.\"in 1978, a self-confessed uvf member, robert campbell, was convicted of the bombing together with the 1976 sectarian killing of john morrow, a workman mistaken for a catholic.pat arthurs, who was 14 years of age when her mother was killed in the bombing, has described how the 'disinformation' peddled by the ruc and british army left her confused and made it more difficult for her family to come to terms with the loss. pat's father, who was also in mcgurk's, survived the attack.in her heart, pat always knew the bombing had been carried out by loyalists but there was always a doubt. and then there was the stigma. \"i had to grow up with people saying that maybe my mother or father had something to do with the murder of 15 people,\" said pat.mary irvine, whose mother was killed in the bombing, said that while everyone else seemed to have forgotten about what happened, the people of the new lodge road and local community have supported relatives and survivors for thirty years.mary particularly remembered the late paddy mcmanus, a local sinn fein councillor \"who had kept the memory of what happened in mcgurk's alive.\"almost a thousand people packed st. patrick's chapel on donegall street for a memorial mass this week. following the service fifteen wreaths, one for each victim, were carried by relatives leading a silent candlelit procession to a new memorial at great george's street.at the site where so many had died, fr david white condemned 'careless reporting' which had added to the grief.\"the bombing of paddy mcgurk's was a callous and cowardly sectarian act,\" said fr white, \"and the enormous pain inflicted by the death of so many was intensified when the army and police personnel, together with the media, rushed to blame republicans.\"", "templates": [{"incident_type": "die", "Victim":
